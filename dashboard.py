        ## Welcome to the Finance Toolkit Dashboard! üëã

        This dashboard is powered by the Finance Toolkit, an open-source toolkit in which 200+ relevant financial ratios,
        indicators and performance measurements are written down in the most simplistic way allowing for complete
        transparency of the method of calculation. Once you've entered you're API key you are ready to go!

        The key features of this dashboard are as follows:

        - üè¢ Compare a small or large selection of tickers for any period (10+ years for Premium users, max 5 years for
        Free users).
        - üìÉ Plot any item from the Financial Statements, e.g. Shareholder's Equity from the Balance Sheet, Revenue from
        the Income Statement and Operating Cash Flow from the Cash Flow Statement.
        - üí∏ Compare 150+ financial ratios, technical indicators, performance metrics and risk metrics.
        - üìà Show quarterly results, growth rates, trailing twelve months (TTM) as well as tables (with the option
        to download the data)

        Find below a demonstration of what is possible once you have entered your API key.

        Within the configurations sections you have the following options:
        - **Stock Ticker**: you can select out over 30.000 companies. You can select any amount
        of tickers here to collect data from. These tickers will be plotted together in a graph once you press the button.
        If you are looking for foreign exchanges (outside of the US) you can enable the toggle to show these. Note
        that this only applies for Premium users.
        - **Start Date & End Date**: you can select the start and end date for the data you want to collect, when you have
        a Premium plan this defaults to 10 years, for the Free plan this defaults to 5 years (maximum period).
        - **Metrics:** this includes a wide variety of metrics from the Finance Toolkit. You can select any amount
        of metrics here which will be plotted in individual graphs.
        - **Quarterly Toggle**: this toggle allows you to switch between quarterly and annual data.
        - **Twelve Trailing Months (TTM)**: this toggle allows you to calculate the Twelve Trailing Months values,
        available when using quarterly data.
        - **Growth Rates**: this toggle allows you to calculate the growth rates (percentage change) of the data.
        - **Include Table**: this toggle allows you to include a table with the plotted data, this also allows
        you to download the data to a CSV file.

        The list below features all available metrics from the Finance Toolkit. In brackets, you will find the
        abbreviation to identify the respective type of metric.
        - **BS** (Balance Sheet Statement) includes all assets, liabilities, and equity items of a company.
        - **IS** (Income Statement) includes all revenue, expenses, and profit items of a company.
        - **CF** (Cash Flow Statement) includes all cash inflows and outflows of a company.
        - **FR** (Financial Ratios) includes all financial ratios that can be calculated from the financial statements.
        - **MD** (Market Data) includes all market data such as adjusted close, cumulative return, and more.
        - **PF** (Performance Metrics) includes all performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and more.
        - **RI** (Risk Metrics) includes all risk metrics such as Value at Risk, Conditional Value at Risk, and more.
        - **TI** (Technical Indicators) includes all technical indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, and more.

        Once you have selected all the configurations you can press the **Collect Data** button to collect data and plot
        (and show tables) according to your selections. You can always change the configurations and press the button
        again to update the plots.

        *It's good to note that data is saved and won't be collected again when this is not required.* You can change
        up the metrics or enable the growth, TTM or table toggle without needing to recollect data. However, if you
        change the tickers, date range or quarterly toggle the dashboard will collect data again. This is however
        relatively quick!
