While browsing a variety of websites, I repeatedly observed significant fluctuations in the same financial metric among different sources. Similarly, the reported financial statements often didn't line up, and there was limited information on the methodology used to calculate each metric.

For example, Microsoft's Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio on the 6th of May, 2023 is reported to be 28.93 (Stockopedia), 32.05 (Morningstar), 32.66 (Macrotrends), 33.09 (Finance Charts), 33.66 (Y Charts), 33.67 (Wall Street Journal), 33.80 (Yahoo Finance) and 34.4 (Companies Market Cap). All of these calculations are correct, however the method of calculation varies leading to different results. Therefore, collecting data from multiple sources can lead to wrong interpretation of the results given that one source could apply a different definition than another. And that is, if that definition is even available as often the underlying methods are hidden behind a paid subscription.

**This is why I designed the FinanceToolkit**, this is an open-source toolkit in which all relevant financial ratios ([150+](#available-metrics)), indicators and performance measurements are written down in the most simplistic way allowing for complete transparency of the method of calculation ([proof](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/blob/main/financetoolkit/ratios/valuation_model.py)). This enables you to avoid dependence on metrics from other providers that do not provide their methods. With a large selection of financial statements in hand, it facilitates streamlined calculations, promoting the adoption of a consistent and universally understood methods and formulas.

The Finance Toolkit not only supports Equities. Even for Options, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies, ETFs, Mutual Funds, Indices, Money Markets, Commodities, Key Economic Indicators and more, the Finance Toolkit can be used to obtain historical data as well as important performance and risk measurements such as the Sharpe Ratio and Value at Risk.

The Finance Toolkit is complimented very well with the [Finance Database 🌎](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase), a database that features 300.000+ symbols containing Equities, ETFs, Funds, Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets. By utilising both, it is possible to do a fully-fledged competitive analysis with the tickers found from the FinanceDatabase inputted into the FinanceToolkit.

# Installation

Before installation, consider starring the project on GitHub which helps others find the project as well. 

<a href="https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit" target="_blank"><img width="1415" alt="image" src="https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/assets/46355364/014109fe-0c68-47d4-99bd-217c69dcea8d"></a>

To install the FinanceToolkit it simply requires the following:

```
pip install financetoolkit -U
````

Then within Python use:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

companies = Toolkit(
    tickers=['GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN'],
    api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY",
)
```
To be able to get started, you need to obtain an API Key from FinancialModelingPrep. This is used to gain access to 30+ years of financial statement both annually and quarterly. Note that the Free plan is limited to 250 requests each day, 5 years of data and only features companies listed on US exchanges.

Through the link you are able to subscribe for the free plan and also premium plans at a **15% discount**. This is an affiliate link and thus supports the project at the same time. I have chosen FinancialModelingPrep as a source as I find it to be the most transparent, reliable and at an affordable price. I have yet to find a platform offering such low prices for the amount of data offered. When you notice that the data is inaccurate or have any other issue related to the data, note that I simply provide the means to access this data and I am not responsible for the accuracy of the data itself. For this, use [their contact form](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/contact) or provide the data yourself. 

The dependencies of the package are on purpose *very slim* so that it will work well with any combination of packages and not result in conflicts.

# Basic Usage

This section is an introduction to the Finance Toolkit. Also see [this notebook](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/getting-started) for a detailed Getting Started guide as well as [this notebook](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/finance-database) that includes the [Finance Database 🌎](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financedatabase) and a proper financial analysis. Next to that, find below a fully-fledged code documentation as well as Jupyter Notebooks in which you can see many examples ranging from basic examples to creating custom ratios to working with your own datasets.

A basic example of how to use the Finance Toolkit is shown below.


````python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

companies = Toolkit(["AAPL", "MSFT"], api_key=API_KEY, start_date="2017-12-31")

# a Historical example
historical_data = companies.get_historical_data()

# a Financial Statement example
income_statement = companies.get_income_statement()

# a Ratios example
profitability_ratios = companies.ratios.collect_profitability_ratios()

# a Models example
extended_dupont_analysis = companies.models.get_extended_dupont_analysis()

# an Options example
all_greeks = companies.options.collect_all_greeks(expiration_time_range=180)

# a Performance example
factor_asset_correlations = companies.performance.get_factor_asset_correlations(
    period="quarterly"
)

# a Risk example
value_at_risk = companies.risk.get_value_at_risk(period="weekly")

# a Technical example
ichimoku_cloud = companies.technicals.get_ichimoku_cloud()

# an Economics example
unemployment_rates = companies.economics.get_unemployment_rate()
````

Generally, the functions return a DataFrame with a multi-index in which all tickers, in this case Apple and Microsoft, are presented. To keep things manageable for this README, I select just Apple but in essence the list of tickers can be endless as I've seen DataFrames with thousands of tickers. The filtering is done through `.loc['AAPL']` and `.xs('AAPL', level=1, axis=1)` based on whether it's fundamental data or historical data respectively.

### Obtaining Historical Data

Obtain historical data on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis. This includes OHLC, volumes, dividends, returns, cumulative returns and volatility calculations for each corresponding period. For example, the a portion of the historical data for Apple is shown below.

| date       |    Open |    High |     Low |   Close |   Adj Close |      Volume |   Dividends |   Return |   Volatility |   Excess Return |   Excess Volatility |   Cumulative Return |

### Obtaining Financial Ratios

Get Profitability Ratios based on the inputted balance sheet, income and cash flow statements. This can be any of the 50+ ratios within the `ratios` module. The `get_` functions show a single ratio whereas the `collect_` functions show an aggregation of multiple ratios. For example, see some of the profitability ratios of Microsoft below.

|                                 |    2017 |    2018 |    2019 |    2020 |    2021 |    2022 |    2023 |

### Obtaining Financial Models

Get an Extended DuPont Analysis based on the inputted balance sheet, income and cash flow statements. This can also be an Enterprise Value Breakdown, Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), Altman Z-Score and many more models. For example, this shows the Extended DuPont Analysis for Apple:

|                         |     2017 |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |
|:------------------------|---------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|

### Obtaining Options and Greeks

Get the Black Scholes Model for both call and put options including the relevant Greeks, in this case Delta, Gamma, Theta and Vega. This can be any of the First, Second or Third Order Greeks as found in the the `options` module. The `get_` functions show a single Greek whereas the `collect_` functions show an aggregation of Greeks. For example, see the delta of the Call options for Apple for multiple expiration times and strike prices below (Stock Price: 185.92, Volatility: 31.59%, Dividend Yield: 0.49% and Risk Free Rate: 3.95%):

|     |   1 Month |   2 Months |   3 Months |   4 Months |   5 Months |   6 Months |
|----:|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| 175 |    0.7686 |     0.7178 |     0.6967 |     0.6857 |     0.6794 |     0.6759 |
| 180 |    0.6659 |     0.64   |     0.6318 |     0.629  |     0.6285 |     0.6291 |
| 185 |    0.5522 |     0.5583 |     0.5648 |     0.571  |     0.5767 |     0.5816 |

Which can also be plotted together with Gamma, Theta and Vega as follows:

![Greeks](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/assets/46355364/3aebe116-c4ac-4845-9801-54d2b4bde0f5)

### Obtaining Performance Metrics

Get the correlations with the factors as defined by Fama-and-French. These include market, size, value, operating profitability and investment. The beauty of all functionality here is that it can be based on any period as the function accepts the period `intraday`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `quarterly` and `yearly`. For example, this shows the quarterly correlations for Apple:

|        |   Mkt-RF |     SMB |     HML |     RMW |     CMA |
|:-------|---------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| 2022Q2 |   0.9177 | -0.1248 | -0.5077 | -0.3202 | -0.2624 |
| 2022Q3 |   0.8092 |  0.1528 | -0.5046 | -0.1997 | -0.5231 |
| 2022Q4 |   0.8998 |  0.2309 | -0.5968 | -0.1868 | -0.5946 |
| 2023Q1 |   0.7737 |  0.1606 | -0.3775 | -0.228  | -0.5707 |
| 2023Q2 |   0.7416 | -0.1166 | -0.2722 |  0.0093 | -0.4745 |

And below the correlations with each factor are plotted over time for both Apple and Microsoft.

![Performance](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/assets/46355364/9c1eff76-b5c8-4bd2-9f47-8ce70bf002db)

### Obtaining Risk Metrics

Get the Value at Risk for each week. Here, the days within each week are considered for the Value at Risk. This makes it so that you can understand within each period what is the expected Value at Risk (VaR) which can again be any period but also based on distributions such as Historical, Gaussian, Student-t, Cornish-Fisher.

|                       |    AAPL |    MSFT |   Benchmark |
|:----------------------|--------:|--------:|------------:|
| 2023-09-25/2023-10-01 | -0.0205 | -0.0133 |     -0.0122 |
| 2023-10-02/2023-10-08 | -0.0048 | -0.0206 |     -0.0108 |
| 2023-10-09/2023-10-15 | -0.0089 | -0.0092 |     -0.0059 |
| 2023-10-16/2023-10-22 | -0.0135 | -0.0124 |     -0.0131 |
| 2023-10-23/2023-10-29 | -0.0224 | -0.0293 |     -0.0139 |

And below the Value at Risk (VaR) for Apple, Microsoft and the benchmark (S&P 500) are plotted also demonstrating the impact of COVID-19.

### Obtaining Technical Indicators

Get the Ichimoku Cloud parameters based on the historical market data. This can be any of the 30+ technical indicators within the `technicals` module. The `get_` functions show a single indicator whereas the `collect_` functions show an aggregation of multiple indicators. For example, see some of the parameters for Apple below:

| Date       |   Base Line |   Conversion Line |   Leading Span A |   Leading Span B |
|:-----------|------------:|------------------:|-----------------:|-----------------:|
| 2023-10-30 |     174.005 |           171.755 |          176.245 |            178.8 |
| 2023-10-31 |     174.005 |           171.755 |          176.37  |            178.8 |
| 2023-11-01 |     174.005 |           170.545 |          176.775 |            178.8 |
| 2023-11-02 |     174.005 |           171.725 |          176.235 |            178.8 |
| 2023-11-03 |     174.005 |           171.725 |          175.558 |            178.8 |

And below the Ichimoku Cloud parameters are plotted for Apple and Microsoft side-by-side.

### Understanding Key Economic Indicators

Get insights for 60+ countries into key economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Unemployment Rates and 3-month and 10-year Government Interest Rates. This is done through the `economics` module and can be used as a standalone module as well by using `from financetoolkit import Economics`. For example see a selection of the countries below:

|      |   Colombia |   United States |   Sweden |   Japan |   Germany |

# Core Functionality and Metrics

The Finance Toolkit has the ability to collect 30+ years of financial statements and calculate 150+ financial metrics. The following list shows all of the available functionality and metrics.

Each ratio and indicator has a corresponding function that can be called directly for example `ratios.get_return_on_equity` or `technicals.get_relative_strength_index`. However, there are also functions that collect multiple ratios or indicators at once such as `ratios.collect_profitability_ratios`. These functions are useful when you want to collect a large amount of ratios or indicators at once.

## Core Functionality

These are the core functionalities of the Finance Toolkit. For any calculation, it often first collects data via these functions. For example, financial ratios require the financial statements and historical data which are obtained through the Toolkit without needing to specify this first.

<details>
    <summary><b>Financial Statements</b></summary>

Acquire a full history of both annual and quarterly financial statements, including [balance sheets](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs#get_balance_sheet_statement), [income statements](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs#get_income_statement), and [cash flow statements](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs#get_cash_flow_statement).

These financial statements are adjusted for the following reasons:

- The financial statements are automatically standardized (based on [these files](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/tree/main/financetoolkit/normalization) to allow for the ability to enter any type of dataset given that the names used are what all of the functionalities rely on.
- The fiscal year of each company is automatically converted to the calendar year so that all companies can be compared on the same basis. As an example, Apple's Q4 2023 is related to the period July 2023 until September 2023 which corresponds to Q3 2023. This means that in the Finance Toolkit these results are reported in the Q3 2023 column.
- When `convert_currency=True` (automatically enabled with a Premium FMP plan) the currency of the historical data is compared to the currency of the financial statements. If they do not match, the financial statement data is converted to the currency of the historical data. This is done to ensure that calculations such as the Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE) have both the Share Price and Earnings denoted in the same currency.

To get insights related to the reported currency, CIK ID and SEC Links, it is possible to retrieve a [statististics statement](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs#get_statistics_statement) as well.

As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(["MSFT", "MU"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY", quarterly=True, start_date='2022-05-01')

balance_sheet_statements = toolkit.get_balance_sheet_statement()

balance_sheet_statements.loc['MU']
```

Which returns:

Get the [rating](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs#get_rating) of the specified tickers. These scores and recommendations are categorized as follows:

- An overall rating
- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
- Return on Equity (ROE)
- Return on Assets (ROA)
- Debt to Equity (DE)
- Price Earnings (PE)
- Price to Book (PB)

As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(["AMZN", "TSLA"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

rating = toolkit.get_rating()

rating.loc['AMZN', 'Rating Recommendation'].tail()
```

Which returns:

    <summary><b>(Intraday) Historical Market Data</b></summary>

Obtain [historical market data](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs#get_historical_data) for the specified tickers. This contains the following columns:

- Open: The opening price for the period.
- High: The highest price for the period.
- Low: The lowest price for the period.
- Close: The closing price for the period.
- Adj Close: The adjusted closing price for the period.
- Volume: The volume for the period.
- Dividends: The dividends for the period.
- Return: The return for the period.
- Volatility: The volatility for the period.
- Excess Return: The excess return for the period. This is defined as the return minus the a predefined risk free rate. Only calculated when excess_return is True.
- Excess Volatility: The excess volatility for the period. This is defined as the volatility of the excess return. Only calculated when `excess_return` is True.
- Cumulative Return: The cumulative return for the period.

If a benchmark ticker is selected, it also calculates the benchmark ticker together with the results. By default this is set to “SPY” (S&P 500 Index) but can be any ticker. This is relevant for calculations for models such as CAPM, Alpha and Beta.

Important to note is that when an `api_key` is included in the Toolkit initialization that the data collection defaults to FinancialModelingPrep which is a more stable source and utilises your subscription. However, if this is undesired, it can be disabled by setting `historical_source` to `YahooFinance`. If data collection fails from FinancialModelingPrep it automatically reverts back to YahooFinance.

You are able to specify the `period` which can be `daily` (default), `weekly`, `monthly`, `quarterly` or `yearly`.

As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit("AAPL", api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

toolkit.get_historical_data(period="yearly")
```

Which returns:

| Date   |     Open |     High |      Low |    Close |   Adj Close |      Volume |   Dividends |     Return |   Volatility |   Excess Return |   Excess Volatility |   Cumulative Return |

    <summary><b>Treasury Rates</b></summary>

Just like the historical market data, obtain a full history for the [treasury rates](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs#get_treasury_data) which also serve as risk-free rate by default allowing for calculations such as the Sharpe Ratio. This also includes normalization of the data as well as auto-adjustments for missing values. It can also be obtained from both FinancialModelingPrep and Yahoo Finance.

It returns the following columns:

- 13 Week Treasury Bond
- 5 Year Treasury Bond
- 10 Year Treasury Bond
- 30 Year Treasury Bond

By default, the Finance Toolkit uses the 10 Year Treasury Bond as risk-free rate but this can be changed by setting `risk_free_rate` to any of the other treasury rates.

As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

companies = Toolkit(["AAPL", "MSFT"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY", start_date="2023-08-10")

companies.get_treasury_data()
```

    <summary><b>Earnings & Dividend Calendars</b></summary>

Obtain [Earnings Calendars](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs#get_earnings_calendar) for any range of companies. You have the option to obtain the actual dates or to convert to the corresponding quarters and can obtain a rich history. This returns:

- Date: The date of the earnings release.
- EPS: The actual earnings-per-share.
- EPS Estimate: The estimated earnings-per-share.
- Revenue: The actual revenue.
- Revenue Estimate: The estimated revenue.

As an example:

```python

    <summary><b>Analyst Estimates</b></summary>

Obtain the [Analyst Estimates](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs#get_analyst_estimates) which include estimates for Revenue, Earnings-per-Share (EPS), EBITDA, EBIT, Net Income, and SGA Expense from the past and future from a large collection of analysts.

It includes the lower, average and upper bound for each estimate which gives insights whether analysts have reached a consensus on the prices or think wildly different. The larger the difference between the lower and upper bound, the more uncertain the analysts are.

As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(
    ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY", start_date="2021-05-01", quarterly=False
)

analyst_estimates = toolkit.get_analyst_estimates()

analyst_estimates.loc['AAPL']
```

Which returns:

    <summary><b>ESG Scores</b></summary>

[ESG scores](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs#get_esg_scores), which stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance scores, are a crucial metric used by investors and organizations to assess a company’s sustainability and ethical practices. These scores provide valuable insights into a company’s performance in three key areas:

- Environmental (E): The environmental component evaluates a company’s impact on the planet and its efforts to mitigate environmental risks. It includes factors like carbon emissions, energy efficiency, water management, and waste reduction. A high environmental score indicates a company’s commitment to eco-friendly practices and reducing its ecological footprint.
- Social (S): The social component focuses on how a company interacts with its employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which it operates. Key factors in the social score include labor practices, diversity and inclusion, human rights, product safety, and community engagement. A strong social score reflects a company’s dedication to fostering positive relationships and contributing positively to society.
- Governance (G): Governance examines a company’s internal structures, policies, and leadership. It assesses aspects such as board independence, executive compensation, transparency, and the presence of anti-corruption measures. A high governance score signifies strong leadership and a commitment to maintaining high ethical standards and accountability

ESG scores provide investors with a holistic view of a company’s sustainability and ethical practices, allowing them to make more informed investment decisions. These scores are increasingly used to identify socially responsible investments and guide capital towards companies that prioritize long-term sustainability and responsible business practices. As the importance of ESG considerations continues to grow, companies are motivated to improve their ESG scores, not only for ethical reasons but also to attract investors who value sustainable and responsible business practices.

As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(
    ["MSFT", "TSLA", "AMZN"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY", start_date="2022-08-01", quarterly=False
)

esg_scores = toolkit.get_esg_scores()

esg_scores.xs("MSFT", level=1, axis=1)

## Discover Instruments

The Discovery module contains lists of companies, cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, etfs and indices including screeners, quotes, performance metrics and more to find and select tickers to use in the Finance Toolkit.  **Find the Notebook [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/discovery-module) and the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/discovery) which includes an explanation about the functionality, the parameters and an example.**

<details>
    <summary><b>Companies</b></summary>

Screen stocks, obtain a list of companies, quotes, floating shares, sectors performance, biggest gainers, biggest losers, most active stocks and delisted companies.

> **Search Instruments**

The search instruments function allows you to search for a company or financial instrument by name. It returns a dataframe with all the symbols that match the query. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/discovery#search_instruments).

As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Discovery

discovery = Discovery(api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

discovery.search_instruments(query='META')
```

Which returns:

| Symbol   | Name                                  | Currency   | Exchange               | Exchange Code   |

| META.JK  | PT Nusantara Infrastructure Tbk       | IDR        | Jakarta Stock Exchange | JKT             |

> **Stock Screener**

Screen stocks based on a set of criteria. This can be useful to find companies that match a specific criteria or your analysis. Further filtering can be done by utilising the Finance Toolkit and calculating the relevant ratios to filter by. This can be:

- Market capitalization (market_cap_higher, market_cap_lower)
- Price (price_higher, price_lower)
- Beta (beta_higher, beta_lower)
- Volume (volume_higher, volume_lower)
- Dividend (dividend_higher, dividend_lower)

Note that the limit is 1000 companies. Thus if you hit the 1000, it is recommended to narrow down your search to prevent companies from being excluded simply because of this limit. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/discovery#get_stock_screener).

As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Discovery

discovery = Discovery(api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

discovery.get_stock_screener(
    market_cap_higher=1000000,
    market_cap_lower=200000000000,
    price_higher=100,
    price_lower=200,
    beta_higher=1,
    beta_lower=1.5,
    volume_higher=100000,
    volume_lower=2000000,
    dividend_higher=1,
    dividend_lower=2,
    is_etf=False
)
```

Which returns:

## Financial Ratios

The Ratios Module contains over 50+ ratios that can be used to analyse companies. These ratios are divided into 5 categories which are efficiency, liquidity, profitability, solvency and valuation. Each ratio is calculated using the data from the Toolkit module.  **Find the Notebook [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/ratios-module) and the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/ratios) which includes an explanation about the ratio, the parameters and an example.**

It is also possible to define custom ratios and calculate these automatically based on the balance sheet, income and cash flow statements. With this, it is possible to calculate any collection of custom ratios without needing to understanding the backend of the Finance Toolkit. Learn how [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/custom-ratios).

All of these ratios can be calculated based on (lagged) growth as well as trailing (e.g. TTM) metrics. This is embedded in all ratios as well as the financial statements themselves which means it is possible to calculate revenue growth and 12-month (TTM) Price-to-Earnings with the parameters `growth=True` and `trailing=4` respectively. Note that trailing is based on periods therefore TTM can only be calculated by setting `quarterly=True` in the Toolkit initialization.

<details>
  <summary><b>Efficiency Ratios ⚙️</b></summary>

The efficiency ratios are used to assess how well a company utilizes its assets and liabilities to generate revenue. They provide insight into the company’s operational efficiency and its ability to manage its assets and liabilities.

All ratios can be called by using `get_` or `collect_` to get a single ratio or to obtain all ratios of the category respectively. E.g. `get_asset_turnover_ratio` or `collect_efficiency_ratios`. As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(["AAPL", "TSLA"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

# Collect all Ratios
toolkit.ratios.collect_efficiency_ratios()

# Get an Individual Ratio
toolkit.ratios.get_asset_turnover_ratio()
```

> **Asset Turnover Ratio**

The asset turnover ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s net sales (revenue) by its average total assets. It measures how well a company utilizes its assets to generate revenue. A higher asset turnover ratio indicates that the company is generating more revenue per unit of assets, which is generally seen as a positive sign of operational efficiency. See documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/ratios#get_asset_turnover_ratio).

> **Inventory Turnover Ratio**

The inventory turnover ratio is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory value. It indicates how many times a company’s inventory is sold and replaced over a period. A higher inventory turnover ratio suggests that a company is effectively managing its inventory by quickly converting it into sales. See documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/ratios#get_inventory_turnover_ratio).

> **Days of Inventory Outstanding**

The days sales in inventory ratio (DSI) is calculated by dividing the average inventory by the cost of goods sold (COGS) and then multiplying by the number of days in the period. It represents the average number of days it takes for a company to sell its inventory. A lower DSI indicates that the company is selling its inventory more quickly. See documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/ratios#get_days_of_inventory_outstanding).

> **Days of Sales Outstanding**

The days of sales outstanding (DSO) ratio is calculated by dividing the accounts receivable by the total credit sales and then multiplying by the number of days in the period. It represents the average number of days it takes for a company to collect payment on its credit sales. A lower DSO indicates that the company is collecting payments more quickly. See documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/ratios#get_days_of_sales_outstanding).

> **Operating Cycle**

The operating cycle represents the total time required to purchase inventory, convert it into finished goods, sell the goods to customers, and collect the accounts receivable. It is calculated by adding the days sales in inventory (DSI) and the days of sales outstanding (DSO). See documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/ratios#get_operating_cycle).

> **Accounts Payables Turnover Ratio**

The accounts payable turnover ratio indicates how many times, on average, a company pays off its accounts payable during a specific period. A higher turnover ratio is generally favorable, as it suggests that the company is efficiently managing its payments to suppliers. See documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/ratios#get_accounts_payables_turnover_ratio).

> **Days of Accounts Payable Outstanding**

The days payables outstanding (DPO) ratio is used to assess how efficiently a company manages its accounts payable. It calculates the average number of days it takes for a company to pay its suppliers after receiving an invoice. A higher DPO ratio indicates that the company is taking longer to pay its suppliers, which may have implications for its relationships with suppliers. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/ratios#get_days_of_accounts_payable_outstanding).

> **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)**

The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is an important measure of a company’s liquidity management and efficiency in managing its working capital. It takes into account the time it takes to sell inventory, collect payments from customers, and pay suppliers. A shorter CCC indicates that a company is able to quickly convert its investments into cash, which can be a positive sign of efficient operations. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/ratios#get_cash_conversion_cycle).

> **Cash Conversion Efficiency (CCE)**

The cash conversion efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing the operating cash flow by the revenue. It indicates how much of a company’s sales are converted into cash. A higher cash conversion efficiency ratio is generally favorable, as it suggests that the company is able to convert its sales into cash more efficiently. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/ratios#get_cash_conversion_efficiency).

> **Receivables Turnover**

<details>
  <summary><b>Financial Models</b></summary>

The financial models are used to analyze a company’s financial performance and assess its financial health. They provide insights into the company’s profitability, efficiency, liquidity, solvency, and valuation given that they tend to combine both the financial ratios and the financial statements.

All models can be called by using `get_`. E.g. `get_dupont_analysis` or `get_weighted_average_cost_of_capital`. As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(["AAPL", "TSLA"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

# Get Financial Model results
toolkit.ratios.get_weighted_average_cost_of_capital()

It is a concept often associated with the value investing philosophy, made famous by legendary investors like Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. Understanding intrinsic value is crucial for investors looking to make informed decisions about where to allocate their capital.

This functionality uses DCF, or Discounted Cash Flow which is a widely used financial valuation method that allows investors and analysts to estimate the intrinsic value of an investment or business based on its expected future cash flows. It is a fundamental tool in finance and investment analysis, providing a systematic way to assess the present value of future cash flows while considering the time value of money. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/models#get_intrinsic_valuation).

> **Gordon Growth Model**

The Gordon Growth Model, also known as the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) with Constant Growth, is a method used to estimate the intrinsic value of a stock based on its expected future dividends. The model assumes that dividends will grow at a constant rate indefinitely. The formula essentially discounts the future expected dividends to their present value, taking into account the required rate of return and the growth rate. The numerator represents the expected dividend in the next period and the denominator represents the required rate of return minus the growth rate.

## Options and Greeks

The Options module is meant to calculate theoretical values based on Black Scholes for European Options. This includes the theoretical value of the Option for each Strike Price and Expiration Date which is intelligently chosen. It also includes the First, Second and Third Order Greeks such as Delta, Gamma, Vega, Vomma and Ultima. **Find the Notebook [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/options-module) and the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/options) which includes an explanation about the model, the parameters and an example.**

<details>
  <summary><b>Option Pricing 📊</b></summary>

Option pricing are mathematical models that calculate the theoretical value of an option contract. It is widely used by traders and investors to determine the theoretical value of an option, and to assess the potential risks and rewards of a position.

> **Option Chains**

Get the Option Chains which gives information about the currently available options as reported by Yahoo Finance. This returns the Contract Symbol, Strike Currency, Last Price, Absolute Change, Percent Change, Volume, Open Interest, Bid Pirce, Ask Price, Expiration, Last Trade Date, Implied Volatility and whether the option is In The Money. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/options#get_option_chains).

> **Black Scholes Model**

The Black Scholes Model is a mathematical model used to estimate the price of European-style options. It is widely used by traders and investors to determine the theoretical value of an option, and to assess the potential risks and rewards of a position.

Within Risk Management, defining the theoretical value of an option is important to assess the potential risk and rewards of an option position. A position that could be used to hedge a portfolio, for example, is a long put option. The theoretical value of this option can be used to determine the potential risk and rewards of this position.

The Black Scholes Model is based on several assumptions, including the following:

- The option is European and can only be exercised at expiration.
- The underlying stock follows a lognormal distribution.
- The risk-free rate and volatility of the underlying stock are known and constant.
- The returns on the underlying stock are normally distributed.

Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/options#get_black_scholes_model).

> **Implied Volatility**

The Implied Volatility (IV) is based on the Black Scholes Model and the actual option prices for any of the available expiration dates. Implied Volatility (IV) is a measure of how much the market expects the price of the underlying asset to fluctuate in the future. It is a key component of options pricing and can also be used to calculate the theoretical value of an option. It makes it possible to plot the Volatility Smile for each company and each expiration date as seen below. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/options#get_implied_volatility).

<img style="background-color: white;" alt="Volatility Smile" width="400" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Volatility_smile.svg/1920px-Volatility_smile.svg.png">

> **Binomial Option Pricing Model**

The Binomial Option Pricing Model is a mathematical model used to estimate the price of European and American style options. It does so by creating a binomial tree of price paths for the underlying asset, and then working backwards through the tree to determine the price of the option at each node.

The resulting output is a DataFrame containing the tickers, strike prices and movements as the index and the time to expiration as the columns. The movements index contains the number of up movements and the number of down movements. The output is the binomial tree displayed in a table. E.g. when using 10 time steps, the table for each strike price from each company will contain the actual binomial tree as also depicted in the image as seen below. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/options#get_binomial_model).

> **Stock Price Simulation**

Simulate the Stock Price based on the Binomial Model, a mathematical model used to estimate the price of European and American style options. It does so by creating a binomial tree of price paths for the underlying asset based on the stock price, volatility, risk free rate, dividend yield and time to expiration. The stock price is then simulated based on the up and down movements.

The resulting output is a DataFrame containing the tickers and movements as the index and the time to expiration as the columns. The movements index contains the number of up movements and the number of down movements. The output is the binomial tree displayed in a table. E.g. when using 10 time steps, the table from each company will contain the actual binomial tree's stock prices as also depicted in the image as seen below.

> **Dual Delta**

The dual delta is the actual probability of an option finishing in the money which is the first derivative of option price with respect to strike. The Dual Delta can be interpreted as the probability of an option finishing in the money. For example, if the Dual Delta is 0.5, then the probability of the option finishing in the money is 50%. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/options#get_dual_delta).

> **Vega**

The vega is the rate of change of the option price with respect to the volatility of the underlying asset. The Vega can be interpreted as follows:

    <summary><b>Second-Order Greeks</b></summary>

The second-order greeks are are Gamma, Dual Gamma, Vanna, Charm, Vomma, Vera and Veta. These greeks are used to assess the sensitivity of the first-order greeks to small changes in the underlying asset’s price, volatility, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, and strike price.

All greeks can be called by using `get_` or `collect_` to get a single greek or to obtain all greeks of the order respectively. E.g. `get_gamma` or `collect_second_order_greeks`. As an example:

```python

toolkit.options.get_gamma()
```

> **Gamma**

The gamma is the rate of change of the delta with respect to the price of the underlying asset. The Gamma can be interpreted as follows:

- If Gamma is high, it indicates that the option’s Delta is highly sensitive to changes in the underlying asset’s price. The option’s Delta will change more significantly with small movements in the stock price.
- If Gamma is low, it suggests that the option’s Delta is relatively insensitive to changes in the underlying asset’s price. The option’s Delta changes more gradually with movements in the stock price.

Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/options#get_gamma).

> **Dual Gamma**

Similar to Dual Delta, the Dual Gamma measures how fast dual delta changes with respect to the strike price. It therefore measures the change in the probability of an option finishing in the money with respect to the strike price. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/options#get_dual_gamma).

> **Vanna**

The vanna is the rate of change of the vega with respect to the price of the underlying asset. The Vanna can be interpreted as follows:

- If Vanna is positive, it indicates that the Delta of the option becomes more positive as both the underlying asset’s price and implied volatility increase, and more negative as they both decrease.
- If Vanna is negative, it suggests that the Delta of the option becomes more negative as both the underlying asset’s price and implied volatility increase, and more positive as they both decrease.

Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/options#get_vanna).

> **Charm**

The charm is the rate of change of the delta with respect to the time to expiration. The Charm can be interpreted as follows:

- If Charm is positive, it suggests that the option’s Delta is becoming more positive over time. In other words, the option is gaining sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset’s price as time passes.
- If Charm is negative, it indicates that the option’s Delta is becoming more negative over time. The option is losing sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset’s price as time passes.

Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/options#get_charm).

> **Vomma**

The vomma is the rate of change of the vega with respect to the volatility of the underlying asset. The vomma can be interpreted as follows:

Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/options#get_veta).

> **Partial Derivative**

The partial derivative is the rate of change of the option price with respect to the strike price. The partial derivative is used in the Breeden-Litzenberger theorem is used for risk-neutral valuation and was developed by Fischer Black and Robert Litzenberger in 1978. The theorem states that the price of any derivative security can be calculated by finding the expected value of the derivative under a risk-neutral measure. The theorem is based on the Black-Scholes model and the assumption that the underlying asset follows a lognormal distribution.

## Performance Metrics

The Performance module is meant to calculate important performance metrics such as Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Treynor Ratio, Information Ratio, Jensen's Alpha, Beta, Capital Asset Pricing Model, Factor Models and more. **Find the Notebook [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/performance-module) and the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance) which includes an explanation about the performance metrics, the parameters and an example.**

<details>
    <summary><b>Performance Metrics</b></summary>

The performance metrics are used to assess the performance of a portfolio or investment strategy. They provide insights into the risk-adjusted returns of a portfolio or investment strategy, and can be used to compare the performance of different assets or investment strategies.

All performance metrics can be called by using `get_` to get a single metric. E.g. `get_alpha` or `get_beta`. As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(["AAPL", "TSLA"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

# Get Performance Metric Results
toolkit.performance.get_beta()
```

> **Beta**

Beta is a financial metric used to assess the systematic risk of a stock or investment in relation to the overall market. It provides valuable insights into how a particular asset’s returns tend to move in response to fluctuations in the broader market. A stock’s Beta is calculated by analyzing its historical price movements and their correlation with the movements of a market index, typically the benchmark index like the S&P 500. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_beta).

> **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**

CAPM, or the Capital Asset Pricing Model, is a financial model used to estimate the expected return on an investment, such as a stock or portfolio of stocks. It provides a framework for evaluating the risk and return trade-off of an asset or portfolio in relation to the overall market. CAPM is based on the following key components:

- Risk-Free Rate (Rf): This is the theoretical return an investor could earn from an investment with no risk of financial loss. It is typically based on the yield of a government bond.
- Market Risk Premium (Rm- Rf): This represents the additional return that investors expect to earn for taking on the risk of investing in the overall market as opposed to a risk-free asset. It is calculated as the difference between the expected return of the market (Rm) and the risk-free rate (Rf).
- Beta (β): Beta is a measure of an asset’s or portfolio’s sensitivity to market movements. It quantifies how much an asset’s returns are expected to move in relation to changes in the overall market. A beta of 1 indicates that the asset moves in line with the market, while a beta greater than 1 suggests higher volatility, and a beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility.

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a widely used financial model that helps in determining the expected return of an asset or portfolio based on its systematic risk and the prevailing risk-free rate in the market. CAPM provides insights into how an asset or investment should be priced in order to offer an appropriate rate of return, given its level of risk compared to the overall market. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_capital_asset_pricing_model).

> **Factor Asset Correlations**

Finds factor exposures for each asset. The major difference between the Fama and French Model here is that the correlation is taken as opposed to a Linear Regression in which the R-squared or Slope can be used to understand the exposure to each factor. For assessing the exposure or influence of a stock to external factors, it’s often preferable to use R-squared (R²) or Beta because it explicitly measures how well the factors explain the stock’s returns. A higher R² indicates that the stock’s returns are more closely related to the factors, and thus, the factors have a greater influence on the stock’s performance. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_factor_asset_correlations).

> **Factor Correlations**

Calculates factor correlations between each factor. This is useful to understand how correlated each factor is to each other. This is based off the Fama and French 5 Factor model which includes:

- Market Risk Premium (Mkt-RF): Represents the additional return that investors expect to earn for taking on the risk of investing in the overall market as opposed to a risk-free asset.
- Size Premium (SMB): Reflects the historical excess return of small-cap stocks over large-cap stocks.
- Value Premium (HML): Captures the historical excess return of value stocks over growth stocks.
- Profitability (RMW): Measures the historical excess return of high profitability stocks over low profitability stocks.
- Investment (CMA): Quantifies the historical excess return of low investment stocks over high investment stocks.

Optionally, it is also possible to see the correlation between the risk-free rate and each factor. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_factor_correlations).

> **Fama-French 5 Factor Model (FF)**

The Fama and French 5 Factor model is a widely used financial model that helps estimate the expected return of financial assets, such as stocks or portfolios, based on five key factors:

- Market Risk Premium (Mkt-RF): Represents the additional return that investors expect to earn for taking on the risk of investing in the overall market as opposed to a risk-free asset.
- Size Premium (SMB): Reflects the historical excess return of small-cap stocks over large-cap stocks.
- Value Premium (HML): Captures the historical excess return of value stocks over growth stocks.
- Profitability (RMW): Measures the historical excess return of high profitability stocks over low profitability stocks.
- Investment (CMA): Quantifies the historical excess return of low investment stocks over high investment stocks.

The model can perform both a Simple Linear Regression on each factor as well as a Multi Linear Regression which includes all factors. Generally, a multi linear regression is applied but if you wish to see individual R-squared values for each factor you can select the simple linear regression method. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_fama_and_french_model).

> **Alpha**

Alpha, in a general sense, represents the excess return an investment generates relative to a benchmark or a risk-adjusted return. It can be positive (indicating the investment outperformed the benchmark) or negative (indicating underperformance). Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_alpha).

> **Jensen's Alpha**

Calculate Jensen’s Alpha, a measure of an asset’s performance relative to its expected return based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Jensen’s Alpha is used to assess whether an investment has outperformed or underperformed its expected return given its systematic risk, as represented by the asset’s Beta. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_jensens_alpha).

> **Treynor Ratio**

The Treynor Ratio, also known as Treynor’s Measure or the Reward-to-Variability Ratio, is a financial metric used to assess the risk-adjusted performance of an investment portfolio or asset. It measures the excess return generated by the portfolio per unit of systematic or market risk, often represented by Beta. The Treynor Ratio is a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of investments in relation to their market risk exposure. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_treynor_ratio).

> **Sharpe Ratio**

The Sharpe ratio is calculated as the difference between the expected return of the asset or portfolio and the risk-free rate of return, divided by the standard deviation of the asset or portfolio’s excess return. It quantifies the amount of return generated for each unit of risk assumed, providing insights into the investment’s performance relative to the risk taken. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_sharpe_ratio).

> **Sortino Ratio**

The Sortino Ratio is a financial metric used to assess the risk-adjusted performance of an investment portfolio or asset by considering only the downside risk. It measures the excess return generated by the portfolio per unit of downside risk, specifically, the standard deviation of negative returns. The Sortino Ratio is particularly useful for investors who are primarily concerned with minimizing the downside risk of their investments. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_sortino_ratio).

> **Ulcer Performance Index (UPI)**

Calculate the Ulcer Performance Index (UPI), alternatively called Martin ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return that evaluates the excess return of an investment portfolio or asset per unit of risk taken. It can be used to compare volatilities in different stocks or show stocks go into Ulcer territory. Similar to the Sharpe Ratio, a higher UPI is better than a lower one (since investors prefer more return for less risk). Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_ulcer_performance_index).

> **M2 Ratio**

The M2 Ratio, also known as the Modigliani-Modigliani Measure, is a financial metric used to evaluate the risk-adjusted performance of an investment portfolio or strategy. It assesses the excess return generated by the portfolio relative to a risk-free investment, taking into account the portfolio’s volatility or risk. The M2 Ratio helps investors and portfolio managers determine whether the portfolio is delivering returns that justify its level of risk. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_m2_ratio).

> **Tracking Error**

Tracking Error is a financial metric that quantifies the volatility or dispersion of the difference between the returns of an investment portfolio or asset and the returns of a benchmark index. It measures how closely the portfolio tracks its benchmark and provides insights into the consistency of the portfolio’s performance relative to the benchmark. A higher Tracking Error indicates greater divergence from the benchmark, while a lower Tracking Error suggests that the portfolio closely follows the benchmark. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_tracking_error).

> **Information Ratio**

The Information Ratio (IR), also known as the Information Coefficient, is a financial metric that assesses the risk-adjusted performance of a portfolio or investment strategy relative to a benchmark index. It quantifies how much excess return the portfolio generates for each unit of tracking error (volatility of tracking error). The Information Ratio is commonly used by portfolio managers, financial analysts, and investors to evaluate the skill of a portfolio manager in generating returns beyond what would be expected based on the risk taken. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_information_ratio).

> **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**

The Compound Annual Growth Rate is a measure that provides the mean growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time. It is a useful measure for comparing the performance of investments over different time periods or across different asset classes. The CGR is calculated by taking the ratio of the final value to the initial value, raising it to the inverse of the number of periods, and then subtracting one. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/performance#get_compound_growth_rate).

toolkit = Toolkit(["AAPL", "TSLA"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

# Get Risk Metric Results
toolkit.risk.get_value_at_risk()
```

> **Value at Risk (VaR)**

Value at Risk (VaR) is a risk management metric that quantifies the maximum potential loss an investment portfolio or asset may experience over a specified time horizon and confidence level. It provides insights into the downside risk associated with an investment and helps investors make informed decisions about risk tolerance. The VaR is calculated as the quantile of the return distribution, representing the loss threshold that is not expected to be exceeded with a given confidence level (e.g., 5% for alpha=0.05). Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/risk#get_value_at_risk).

> **Conditional Value at Risk (cVaR)**

Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is a risk management metric that quantifies the loss in the worst % of cases of an investment portfolio or asset may experience over a specified time horizon and confidence level. It provides insights into the downside risk associated with an investment and helps investors make informed decisions about risk tolerance. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/risk#get_conditional_value_at_risk).

The Ulcer Index is a financial metric used to assess the risk and volatility of an investment portfolio or asset. Developed by Peter Martin in the 1980s, the Ulcer Index is particularly useful for evaluating the downside risk and drawdowns associated with investments. The Ulcer Index differs from traditional volatility measures like standard deviation or variance because it focuses on the depth and duration of drawdowns rather than the dispersion of returns.

> **Skewness**

Skewness is a statistical measure used in finance to assess the asymmetry in the distribution of returns for an investment portfolio or asset over a defined period. It offers valuable insights into the shape of the return distribution, indicating whether returns are skewed towards the positive or negative side of the mean. Skewness is a crucial tool for investors and analysts seeking to understand the potential risk and return characteristics of an investment, aiding in the assessment of the distribution’s tails and potential outliers. It provides a means to gauge the level of skew in returns, enabling more informed investment decisions and risk management strategies. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/risk#get_skewness).

> **Kurtosis**

Kurtosis is a statistical measure used in finance to evaluate the shape of the probability distribution of returns for an investment portfolio or asset over a defined time period. It assesses the “tailedness” of the return distribution, indicating whether returns have fatter or thinner tails compared to a normal distribution. Kurtosis plays a critical role in risk assessment by revealing the potential presence of extreme outliers or the likelihood of heavy tails in the return data. This information aids investors and analysts in understanding the degree of risk associated with an investment and assists in making more informed decisions regarding risk tolerance. In essence, kurtosis serves as a valuable tool for comprehending the distribution characteristics of returns, offering insights into the potential for rare but significant events in the financial markets.

This module can be called directly via the Toolkit but also separately if desired through `from financetoolkit import Economics`. **Find the Notebook [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/economics-module) and the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics) which includes an explanation about each indicator, the parameters and an example.**

<details>
    <summary><b>Economy 💵</b></summary>

The economy section contains key economic indicators that help in understanding the health and performance of more than 60 different countries. This includes the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Confidence Index (CCI), Business Confidence Index (BCI), Composite Leading Indicator (CLI), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), House and Rent Prices, Share Prices and more.

All economy metrics can be called by using `get_` to get a single metric. E.g. `get_gross_domestic_product` or `get_consumer_price_index`. As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(["AAPL", "TSLA"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

# Get Economy Results
toolkit.economics.get_consumer_price_index()
```

> **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**

The Gross Domestic Product is the total value of goods produced and services provided in a country during one year. The data is available in two forms: compared to the previous year’s value or compared to the previous period. The year on year data is the GDP compared to the same quarter in the previous year. The quarter on quarter data is the GDP compared to the previous quarter. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_gross_domestic_product).

It is possible to view the growth rate on a quarterly or annual basis, the default is dependent on the quarterly parameter. The growth rate is the percentage change in the GDP compared to the previous period. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_gross_domestic_product_growth).

Lastly, it is possible to view the growth rate on a quarterly or annual basis, the default is dependent on the quarterly parameter. The growth rate is the percentage change in the GDP compared to the previous period. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_gross_domestic_product_forecast).

> **Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)**

This consumer confidence indicator provides an indication of future developments of households consumption and saving, based upon answers regarding their expected financial situation, their sentiment about the general economic situation, unemployment and capability of savings.

An indicator above 100 signals a boost in the consumers’ confidence towards the future economic situation, as a consequence of which they are less prone to save, and more inclined to spend money on major purchases in the next 12 months. Values below 100 indicate a pessimistic attitude towards future developments in the economy, possibly resulting in a tendency to save more and consume less. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_consumer_confidence_index).

> **Business Confidence Index (BCI)**

This business confidence indicator provides information on future developments, based upon opinion surveys on developments in production, orders and stocks of finished goods in the industry sector. It can be used to monitor output growth and to anticipate turning points in economic activity.

Numbers above 100 suggest an increased confidence in near future business performance, and numbers below 100 indicate pessimism towards future performance. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_business_confidence_index).

> **Composite Leading Indicator (CLI)**

The composite leading indicator (CLI) is designed to provide early signals of turning points in business cycles showing fluctuation of the economic activity around its long term potential level. CLIs show short-term economic movements in qualitative rather than quantitative terms. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_composite_leading_indicator).

> **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

Inflation measured by consumer price index (CPI) is defined as the change in the prices of a basket of goods and services that are typically purchased by specific groups of households. Inflation is measured in terms an index, 2015 base year with a breakdown for food, energy and total.

Inflation measures the erosion of living standards. A consumer price index is estimated as a series of summary measures of the period-to-period proportional change in the prices of a fixed set of consumer goods and services of constant quantity and characteristics, acquired, used or paid for by the reference population.

Each summary measure is constructed as a weighted average of a large number of elementary aggregate indices. Each of the elementary aggregate indices is estimated using a sample of prices for a defined set of goods and services obtained in, or by residents of, a specific region from a given set of outlets or other sources of consumption goods and services. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_consumer_price_index).

> **Producer Price Index (PPI)**

Producer price indices in manufacturing measure the rate of change in prices of products sold as they leave the producer. They exclude any taxes, transport and trade margins that the purchaser may have to pay. PPIs provide measures of average movements of prices received by the producers of various commodities. hey are often seen as advanced indicators of price changes throughout the economy, including changes in the prices of consumer goods and services.

Manufacturing covers the production of semi-processed goods and other intermediate goods as well as final products such as consumer goods and capital equipment. A variety of price indices may be used to measure inflation in an economy. These include consumer price indices (CPI), price indices relating to specific goods and/or services, GDP deflators and producer price indices (PPI). Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_producer_price_index).

> **House Prices**

In most cases, the nominal house price index covers the sales of newly-built and existing dwellings, following the recommendations from the RPPI (Residential Property Prices Indices) manual.

The real house price index is given by the ratio of the nominal house price index to the consumers’ expenditure deflator in each country from the OECD national accounts database. Both indices are seasonally adjusted. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_house_prices).

> **Rent Prices**

The price to rent ratio is the nominal house price index divided by the housing rent price index and can be considered as a measure of the profitability of house ownership. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_rent_prices).

> **Share Prices**

Share price indices are calculated from the prices of common shares of companies traded on national or foreign stock exchanges. They are usually determined by the stock exchange, using the closing daily values for the monthly data, and normally expressed as simple arithmetic averages of the daily data.

A share price index measures how the value of the stocks in the index is changing, a share return index tells the investor what their “return” is, meaning how much money they would make as a result of investing in that basket of shares.

A price index measures changes in the market capitalisation of the basket of shares in the index whereas a return index adds on to the price index the value of dividend payments, assuming they are re-invested in the same stocks. Occasionally agencies such as central banks will compile share indices. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_share_prices).

All finance metrics can be called by using `get_` to get a single metric. E.g. `get_long_term_interest_rate` or `get_narrow_and_broad_money`. As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(["AAPL", "TSLA"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

# Get Finance Results
toolkit.economics.get_long_term_interest_rate()
```

> **Long Term Interest Rates (10 year)**

Long-term interest rates refer to government bonds maturing in ten years. Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued.

In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_long_term_interest_rate).

> **Short Term Interest Rates (3 month)**

Short-term interest rates are the rates at which short-term borrowings are effected between financial institutions or the rate at which short-term government paper is issued or traded in the market. Short-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage.

Short-term interest rates are based on three-month money market rates where available. Typical standardised names are “money market rate” and “treasury bill rate”. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_short_term_interest_rate).

> ***Narrow Money (M1)**

M1 includes currency i.e. banknotes and coins, plus overnight deposits. M1 is expressed as a seasonally adjusted index based on 2015=100.

Broad money (M3) includes currency, deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two years, deposits redeemable at notice of up to three months and repurchase agreements, money market fund shares/units and debt securities up to two years. M3 is measured as a seasonally adjusted index based on 2015=100. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_narrow_and_broad_money).

> **Broad Money (M3)**

Broad money (M3) includes currency, deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two years, deposits redeemable at notice of up to three months and repurchase agreements, money market fund shares/units and debt securities up to two years. M3 is measured as a seasonally adjusted index based on 2015=100. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_narrow_and_broad_money).

> **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)**

Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are the rates of currency conversion that try to equalise the purchasing power of different currencies, by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries. The basket of goods and services priced is a sample of all those that are part of final expenditures: final consumption of households and government, fixed capital formation, and net exports. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_purchasing_power_parity).

> **Exchange Rates**

Exchange rates are defined as the price of one country’s’ currency in relation to another country’s currency. This indicator is measured in terms of national currency per US dollar. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_exchange_rates).

    <summary><b>Fixed Income 📃 </b></summary>

The fixed income metrics revolve around option-adjusted spreads, effective yields and total returns of corporate bonds based on the ICE BofA US Corporate Indices. It is possible to view both the indices of the ratings (AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B and CCC) and the maturities (1-3 years, 3-5 years, 5-7 years, 7-10 years, 10-15 years, 15-30 years and 30+ years).

All fixed income metrics can be called by using `get_` to get a single metric. E.g. `get_option_adjusted_spread` or `get_yield_to_worst`. As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(["AAPL", "TSLA"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

# Get Fixed Income Results
toolkit.economics.get_option_adjusted_spread()
```

> Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS)

The Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) is the spread relative to a risk-free interest rate, usually measured in basis points (bp), that equates the theoretical present value of a series of uncertain cash flows to the market price of a fixed-income investment. The spread is added to the risk-free rate to compensate for the uncertainty of the cash flows. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_option_adjusted_spread).

> Effective Yield

The Effective Yield is the yield of a bond, calculated by dividing the bond's coupon payments by its market price. The effective yield is not the same as the stated yield, which is the yield on the bond's coupon payments divided by the bond's principal value. The effective yield is a more accurate measure of a bond's return, as it takes into account the fact that the investor will not hold the bond to maturity and will likely sell it before it matures. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_effective_yield).

> Total Return

The total return is the actual rate of return of an investment or a pool of investments over a given evaluation period. Total return includes interest, capital gains, dividends and distributions realized over a given period of time. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_total_return).

> Yield to Worst

Yield to worst is the lowest potential yield that a bond can generate without the issuer defaulting. The standard US convention for this series is to use semi-annual coupon payments, whereas the standard in the foreign markets is to use coupon payments with frequencies of annual, semi-annual, quarterly, and monthly. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_yield_to_worst).

    <summary><b>Environment 💚</b></summary>

The environment metrics revolve around renewable energy, environmental tax, greenhouse gas emissions, crude oil production and crude oil prices of countries. This includes the renewable energy as a percentage of total energy, environmental tax as a percentage of GDP, greenhouse gas emissions, crude oil production and crude oil prices.

All environment metrics can be called by using `get_` to get a single metric. E.g. `get_renewable_energy` or `get_crude_oil_prices`. As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(["AAPL", "TSLA"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

# Get Environment Results
toolkit.economics.get_crude_oil_prices()
```

> **Renewable Energy as % of Total Energy**

Renewable energy is defined as the contribution of renewables to total primary energy supply (TPES). Renewables include the primary energy equivalent of hydro (excluding pumped storage), geothermal, solar, wind, tide and wave sources.

Energy derived from solid biofuels, biogasoline, biodiesels, other liquid biofuels, biogases and the renewable fraction of municipal waste are also included. Biofuels are defined as fuels derived directly or indirectly from biomass (material obtained from living or recently living organisms).

This includes wood, vegetal waste (including wood waste and crops used for energy production), ethanol, animal materials/wastes and sulphite lyes. Municipal waste comprises wastes produced by the residential, commercial and public service sectors that are collected by local authorities for disposal in a central location for the production of heat and/or power. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_renewable_energy).

> **Environmental Tax as % of GDP**

Environmentally related taxes are an important instrument for governments to shape relative prices of goods and services.

The characteristics of such taxes included in the database (e.g. revenue, tax base, tax rates, exemptions, etc.) are used to construct the environmentally related tax revenues with a breakdown by environmental domain:

- Energy products (including vehicle fuels);
- Motor vehicles and transport services;
- Measured or estimated emissions to air and water, ozone depleting substances, certain non-point sources of water pollution, waste management and noise, as well as management of water, land, soil, forests, biodiversity, wildlife and fish stocks.

The data have been cross-validated and complemented with Revenue statistics from the OECD Tax statistics database and official national sources. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_environmental_tax).

> **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**

Greenhouse gases refer to the sum of seven gases that have direct effects on climate change:

- Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
- Methane (CH4)
- Nitrous Oxide (N2O)
- Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
- Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
- Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
- Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF6)
- Nitrogen Trifluoride (NF3).

The data are expressed in CO2 equivalents and refer to gross direct emissions from human activities. CO2 refers to gross direct emissions from fuel combustion only and data are provided by the International Energy Agency. Other air emissions include emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) given as quantities of SO2 and NO2, emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), and emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC), excluding methane.

Air and greenhouse gas emissions are measured in tonnes per capita and kilogram per capita in which all metrics are converted to tonnes (1000kg) per capita. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_greenhouse_emissions).

> **Crude Oil Production**

Crude oil production is defined as the quantities of oil extracted from the ground after the removal of inert matter or impurities. It includes crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and additives. This indicator is measured in thousand tonne of oil equivalent (toe).

Crude oil is a mineral oil consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons of natural origin, yellow to black in colour, and of variable density and viscosity. NGLs are the liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons produced in the manufacture, purification and stabilisation of natural gas.

Additives are non-hydrocarbon substances added to or blended with a product to modify its properties, for example, to improve its combustion characteristics (e.g. MTBE and tetraethyl lead). Refinery production refers to the output of secondary oil products from an oil refinery. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_crude_oil_production).

> **Crude Oil Prices**

Crude oil import prices come from the IEA’s Crude Oil Import Register and are influenced not only by traditional movements of supply and demand, but also by other factors such as geopolitics.

Information is collected from national agencies according to the type of crude oil, by geographic origin and by quality of crude. Average prices are obtained by dividing value by volume as recorded by customs administrations for each tariff position.

Values are recorded at the time of import and include cost, insurance and freight, but exclude import duties. The nominal crude oil spot price from 2003 to 2011 is for Dubai and from 1970 to 2002 for Arabian Light. This indicator is measured in USD per barrel of oil. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_crude_oil_prices).

    <summary><b>Government 🏛️</b></summary>

The government metrics revolve around the deficit, revenue, spending, debt, financial wealth and production costs of countries. This includes the deficit as a percentage of GDP, revenue as a percentage of GDP, spending as a percentage of GDP, debt as a percentage of GDP, financial wealth as a percentage of GDP and production costs as a percentage of GDP.

All government metrics can be called by using `get_` to get a single metric. E.g. `get_government_statistics` or `get_trust_in_government`. As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(["AAPL", "TSLA"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

# Get Government Results
toolkit.economics.get_government_statistics()
```

> **Deficit as % of GDP**

General government deficit is defined as the balance of income and expenditure of government, including capital income and capital expenditures. “Net lending” means that government has a surplus, and is providing financial resources to other sectors, while “net borrowing” means that government has a deficit, and requires financial resources from other sectors. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_government_statistics).

> **Revenue as % of GDP**

General government revenue is defined as the revenue required to finance the goods and services they provide to citizens and businesses, and to fulfil their redistributive role. Comparing levels of government revenues across countries provides an indication of the importance of the government sector in the economy in terms of available financial resources. The total amount of revenues collected by governments is determined by past and current political decisions. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_government_statistics).

> **Spending as % of GDP**

General government spending is defined as an indicator of the size of government across countries. The large variation in this indicator highlights the variety of countries’ approaches to delivering public goods and services and providing social protection, not necessarily differences in resources spent. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_government_statistics).

> **Debt as % of GDP**

General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_government_statistics).

> **Financial Wealth as % of GDP**

The net financial worth of the general government sector is the total value of its financial assets minus the total value of its outstanding liabilities. The general government sector consists of central, state and local governments as well as social security funds. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_government_statistics).

> **Production Costs as % of GDP**

General government production costs are decisions about the amount and type of goods and services governments produce, as well as on how best to produce them. They are often political in nature and based on a country’s social and cultural context. Governments use a mix of their own employees, capital, and outside contractors (non-profit institutions or private sector entities) to produce goods and services. Government production costs include: compensation costs of general government employees; goods and services used and financed by general government (including intermediate consumption and social transfer in kind via market producers paid for by government); and other costs, including depreciation of capital and other taxes on production less other subsidies on production. The data include government employment and intermediate consumption for output produced by the government for its own use, such as roads and other capital investment projects built by government employees. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_government_statistics).

> **Central Government Spending**

Central government expenditure is defined as the central government budget expenditure as reported in the final central government accounts. Data are based on the System of National accounts (SNA), a set of internationally agreed concepts, definitions, classifications and rules for national accounting. Central government spending by function is the breakdown of expenditures on the basis of the activities governments support. The classification system used to provide this breakdown on an internationally comparable basis is known as Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG). Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_central_government_spending).

> **Trust in Government**

Trust in government refers to the share of people who report having confidence in the national government. The data shown reflect the share of respondents answering “yes” (the other response categories being “no”, and “dont know”) to the survey question: “In this country, do you have confidence in… national government? The sample is ex ante designed to be nationally representative of the population aged 15 and over. This indicator is measured as a percentage of all survey respondents. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_trust_in_government).

    <summary><b>Jobs 🗂️</b></summary>

The jobs metrics revolve around the unemployment rates, labour productivity and income inequality of countries.

All jobs metrics can be called by using `get_` to get a single metric. E.g. `get_unemployment_rate` or `get_income_inequality`. As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(["AAPL", "TSLA"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

# Get Jobs Results
toolkit.economics.get_income_inequality()
```

> **Unemployment Rate**

The unemployed are people of working age who are without work, are available for work, and have taken specific steps to find work. The uniform application of this definition results in estimates of unemployment rates that are more internationally comparable than estimates based on national definitions of unemployment.

This indicator is measured in numbers of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force and it is seasonally adjusted. The labour force is defined as the total number of unemployed people plus those in employment. Data are based on labour force surveys (LFS).

For European Union countries where monthly LFS information is not available, the monthly unemployed figures are estimated by Eurostat. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_unemployment_rate).

> **Labour Productivity**

GDP per hour worked is a measure of labour productivity. It measures how efficiently labour input is combined with other factors of production and used in the production process. Labour input is defined as total hours worked of all persons engaged in production. Labour productivity only partially reflects the productivity of labour in terms of the personal capacities of workers or the intensity of their effort.

The ratio between the output measure and the labour input depends to a large degree on the presence and/or use of other inputs (e.g. capital, intermediate inputs, technical, organisational and efficiency change, economies of scale). Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_labour_productivity).

> **Income Inequality**

Income is defined as household disposable income in a particular year. It consists of earnings, self-employment and capital income and public cash transfers; income taxes and social security contributions paid by households are deducted. The income of the household is attributed to each of its members, with an adjustment to reflect differences in needs for households of different sizes. Income inequality among individuals is measured here by five indicators. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_income_inequality).

</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>Society 👪</b></summary>

The society metrics revolve around the population, young population, working age population, elderly population, fertility rates, old-age dependency ratio and poverty rate of countries.

All society metrics can be called by using `get_` to get a single metric. E.g. `get_population_statistics` or `get_poverty_rate`. As an example:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

toolkit = Toolkit(["AAPL", "TSLA"], api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

# Get Society Results
toolkit.economics.get_poverty_rate()
```

> **Population**

Population is defined as all nationals present in, or temporarily absent from a country, and aliens permanently settled in a country. This indicator shows the number of people that usually live in an area. Growth rates are the annual changes in population resulting from births, deaths and net migration during the year. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_population_statistics).

> **Young Population**

The youth population is defined as those people aged less than 15 as a percentage of the total population. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_population_statistics).

> **Working Age Population**

The working age population is defined as those aged 15 to 64 as a percentage of the total population. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_population_statistics).

> **Elderly Population**

The elderly population is defined as those aged 65 and over as a percentage of the total population. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_population_statistics).

> **Fertility Rates**

The total fertility rate in a specific year is defined as the total number of children that would be born to each woman if she were to live to the end of her child-bearing years and give birth to children in alignment with the prevailing age-specific fertility rates. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_population_statistics).

> **Old-Age Dependency Ratio**

The old-age to working-age demographic ratio is defined as the number of individuals aged 65 and over per 100 people of working age defined as those at ages 20 to 64. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_population_statistics).

> **Poverty Rate**

The poverty rate is the ratio of the number of people (in a given age group) whose income falls below the poverty line; taken as half the median household income of the total population.

It is also available by broad age group:

- child poverty (0 to 17 year-olds);
- working-age poverty (18 to 65 year-olds);
- and elderly poverty (66 year-olds or more).

However, two countries with the same poverty rates may differ in terms of the relative income-level of the poor. Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/economics#get_poverty_rate).

# Questions & Answers

This section includes frequently asked questions and is meant to clear up confusion about certain results and/or deviations from other sources. If you have any questions that are not answered here, feel free to reach out to me via the contact details below.

> **How do you deal with companies that have different fiscal years?**

For any financial statement, I make sure to line it up with the corresponding *calendar* period. For example, Apple's Q4 2023 relates to July to September of 2023. This corresponds to the calendar period Q3 which is why I normalize Apple's numbers to Q3 2023 instead. This is done to allow for comparison between companies that have different fiscal years.

> **Why do the numbers in the financial statements sometimes deviate from the data from FinancialModelingPrep?**

When looking at a company such as Hyundai Motor Company (ticker: 005380.KS), you will notice that the financial statements are reported in KRW (South Korean won). As this specific ticker is listed on the Korean Exchange, the historical market data will also be reported in KRW. However, if you use the ticker HYMTF, which is listed on the American OTC market, the historical market data will be reported in USD. To deal with this discrepancy, the end of year or end of quarter exchange rate is retrieved which is used to convert the financial statements to USD. This is done to prevent ratio calculations such as the Free Cash Flow Yield (which is based on the market capitalization) or Price Earnings Ratio (which is based on the stock price) from being incorrect. This can be disabled by setting `convert_currency=False` in the Toolkit initialization. It is recommended to always use the ticker that is listed on the exchange where the company is based.

> **How can I get TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) and Growth metrics?**

Most functions will have the option to define the `trailing` parameter. This lets you define the number of periods that you want to use to calculate the trailing metrics. For example, if you want to calculate the trailing 12-month (TTM) Price-to-Earnings Ratio, you can set `trailing=4` when you have set `quarterly=True` in the Toolkit initialization. The same goes for growth metrics which can be calculated by setting `growth=True`. This will calculate the growth for each period based on the previous period. This also includes a `lag` parameter in which you can define lagged growth. Furthermore, you can also combine the trailing and growth parameters to get trailing growth. For example, set `trailing=4` and `growth=True`  for the Price-to-Earnings Ratio which will then calculate the TTM growth.

> **How can I save the data periodically so that I don't have to retrieve it every single time again?**

The Toolkit initialization has the ability to add custom datasets which can serve as input for external datasets from different providers but also to prevent downloading all of the same data again. Have a look at [this comment](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/issues/68#issuecomment-1748684501) that explains this further.

> **What is the "Benchmark" that is automatically obtained when acquiring historical data?**

This is related to the `benchmark_ticker` parameter which is set to "SPY" (S&P 500) by default. This is important when calculating performance metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio or Treynor Ratio that require a market return. This can be disabled by setting `benchmark_ticker=None` in the Toolkit initialization.

> **Data collection seems to be slow, what could be the issue?**

Generally, it should take less than 15 seconds to retrieve the historical data of 100 tickers. If it takes much longer, this could be due to reaching the API limit (the Starter plan has 250 requests per minute), due to a slow internet connection or due to unoptimized code. As the Finance Toolkit makes use of threading, initializing the Toolkit with a single ticker will result in a slow process. This is because the Toolkit will have to wait for the previous request to finish before it can start the next one. Therefore, it is recommended to initialize the Toolkit with all tickers you want to analyze. If it is taking 10+ minutes consider having a look at [this issue](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/issues/99#issuecomment-1889726000) that managed to resolve the problem.

> **Are you part of FinancialModelingPrep?**

*No, I am not*. I've merely picked them as the primary data provider given that they have a generous free tier and fair pricing compared to other providers. Therefore, any questions related to the data should go through [their contact form](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/contact). When it comes to any type of ratios, performance metrics, risk metrics, technical indicators or economic indicators, feel free to reach out to me as this is my own work.
