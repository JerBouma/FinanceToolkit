While browsing a variety of websites, I kept finding that the same financial metric can greatly vary per source and so do the financial statements reported while little information is given how the metric was calculated.

For example, Microsoft's Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio on the 6th of May, 2023 is reported to be 28.93 (Stockopedia), 32.05 (Morningstar), 32.66 (Macrotrends), 33.09 (Finance Charts), 33.66 (Y Charts), 33.67 (Wall Street Journal), 33.80 (Yahoo Finance) and 34.4 (Companies Market Cap). All of these calculations are correct, however the method applied varies leading to different results. Therefore, collecting data from multiple sources can lead to wrong interpretation of the results given that one source could be applying a different calculation method than another. And that is, if it is even freely available. Often the calculation is hidden behind a paid subscription.

**This is why I designed the FinanceToolkit**, this is an open-source toolkit in which all relevant financial ratios ([150+](#available-metrics)), indicators and performance measurements are written down in the most simplistic way allowing for complete transparency of the calculation method ([proof](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/blob/main/financetoolkit/ratios/valuation_model.py)). This allows you to not have to rely on metrics from other providers and, given a financial statement, allow for efficient manual calculations. This leads to one uniform method of calculation being applied that is available and understood by everyone.

The Finance Toolkit not only supports Equities. Even for Currencies, Cryptocurrencies, ETFs, Mutual Funds, Indices, Money Markets, Commodities, Key Economic Indicators and more, the Finance Toolkit can be used to obtain historical data as well as important performance and risk measurements such as the Sharpe Ratio and Value at Risk.

The Finance Toolkit is complimented very well with the [Finance Database 🌎](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase), a database that features 300.000+ symbols containing Equities, ETFs, Funds, Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets. By utilising both, it is possible to do a fully-fledged competitive analysis with the tickers found from the FinanceDatabase inputted into the FinanceToolkit.

A basic example of how to use the Finance Toolkit is shown below.


````python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

companies = Toolkit(["AAPL", "MSFT"], api_key=API_KEY, start_date="2017-12-31")

# a Historical example
historical_data = companies.get_historical_data()

# a Financial Statement example
income_statement = companies.get_income_statement()

# a Ratios example
profitability_ratios = companies.ratios.collect_profitability_ratios()

# a Models example
extended_dupont_analysis = companies.models.get_extended_dupont_analysis()

# a Performance example
factor_asset_correlations = companies.performance.get_factor_asset_correlations(period='quarterly')

# a Risk example
value_at_risk = companies.risk.get_value_at_risk(period="weekly")

# a Technical example
ichimoku_cloud = companies.technicals.get_ichimoku_cloud()

# an Economics example
unemployment_rates = companies.economics.get_unemployment_rate()
````

Generally, the functions return a DataFrame with a multi-index in which all tickers, in this case Apple and Microsoft, are presented. To keep things manageable for this README, I select just Apple but in essence the list of tickers can be endless as I've seen DataFrames with thousands of tickers. The filtering is done through `.loc['AAPL']` and `.xs('AAPL', level=1, axis=1)` based on whether it's fundamental data or historical data respectively.

### Obtaining Historical Data

Obtain historical data on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis. This includes OHLC, volumes, dividends, returns, cumulative returns and volatility calculations for each corresponding period. For example, the a portion of the historical data for Apple is shown below.

| date       |    Open |    High |     Low |   Close |   Adj Close |      Volume |   Dividends |   Return |   Volatility |   Excess Return |   Excess Volatility |   Cumulative Return |

### Obtaining Financial Ratios

Get Profitability Ratios based on the inputted balance sheet, income and cash flow statements. This can be any of the 50+ ratios within the `ratios` module. The `get_` functions show a single ratio whereas the `collect_` functions show an aggregation of multiple ratios. For example, see some of the profitability ratios of Microsoft below.

|                                 |    2017 |    2018 |    2019 |    2020 |    2021 |    2022 |    2023 |
|:--------------------------------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|

### Obtaining Financial Models

Get an Extended DuPont Analysis based on the inputted balance sheet, income and cash flow statements. This can also be an Enterprise Value Breakdown, Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), Altman Z-Score and many more models. For example, this shows the Extended DuPont Analysis for Apple:

|                         |     2017 |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |
|:------------------------|---------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|

### Obtaining Performance Metrics

Get the correlations with the factors as defined by Fama-and-French. These include market, size, value, operating profitability and investment. The beauty of all functionality here is that it can be based on any period as the function accepts the period 'weekly', 'monthly', 'quarterly' and 'yearly'. For example, this shows the quarterly correlations for Apple:

|        |   Mkt-RF |     SMB |     HML |     RMW |     CMA |
|:-------|---------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| 2022Q2 |   0.9177 | -0.1248 | -0.5077 | -0.3202 | -0.2624 |
| 2022Q3 |   0.8092 |  0.1528 | -0.5046 | -0.1997 | -0.5231 |
| 2022Q4 |   0.8998 |  0.2309 | -0.5968 | -0.1868 | -0.5946 |
| 2023Q1 |   0.7737 |  0.1606 | -0.3775 | -0.228  | -0.5707 |
| 2023Q2 |   0.7416 | -0.1166 | -0.2722 |  0.0093 | -0.4745 |

And below the correlations with each factor are plotted over time for both Apple and Microsoft.

![Performance](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/assets/46355364/9c1eff76-b5c8-4bd2-9f47-8ce70bf002db)

### Obtaining Risk Metrics

Get the Value at Risk for each week. Here, the days within each week are considered for the Value at Risk. This makes it so that you can understand within each period what is the expected Value at Risk (VaR) which can again be any period but also based on distributions such as Historical, Gaussian, Student-t, Cornish-Fisher.

|                       |    AAPL |    MSFT |   Benchmark |
|:----------------------|--------:|--------:|------------:|
| 2023-09-25/2023-10-01 | -0.0205 | -0.0133 |     -0.0122 |
| 2023-10-02/2023-10-08 | -0.0048 | -0.0206 |     -0.0108 |
| 2023-10-09/2023-10-15 | -0.0089 | -0.0092 |     -0.0059 |
| 2023-10-16/2023-10-22 | -0.0135 | -0.0124 |     -0.0131 |
| 2023-10-23/2023-10-29 | -0.0224 | -0.0293 |     -0.0139 |

And below the Value at Risk (VaR) for Apple, Microsoft and the benchmark (S&P 500) are plotted also demonstrating the impact of COVID-19.

![Risk](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/assets/46355364/a95e5b51-f7fc-4a70-bbb4-bf88b346523e)

### Obtaining Technical Indicators

Get the Ichimoku Cloud parameters based on the historical market data. This can be any of the 30+ technical indicators within the `technicals` module. The `get_` functions show a single indicator whereas the `collect_` functions show an aggregation of multiple indicators. For example, see some of the parameters for Apple below:

| Date       |   Base Line |   Conversion Line |   Leading Span A |   Leading Span B |

### Understanding Key Economic Indicators

Get insights for 60+ countries into key economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Unemployment Rates and 3-month and 10-year Government Interest Rates. This is done through the `economics` module and can be used as a standalone module as well by using `from financetoolkit import Economics`. For example see a selection of the countries below:

|      |   Colombia |   United States |   Sweden |   Japan |   Germany |
|:-----|-----------:|----------------:|---------:|--------:|----------:|
| 2017 |     0.093  |          0.0435 |   0.0686 |  0.0281 |    0.0357 |

# Available Metrics

The Finance Toolkit has the ability to calculate 150+ financial metrics. The following list shows all of the available metrics. Note that the Finance Toolkit is not limited to these ratios and indicators as it is possible to add custom ratios as well. See [this Notebook](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/custom-ratios) for more information.

Each ratio and indicator has a corresponding function that can be called directly for example `ratios.get_return_on_equity` or `technicals.get_relative_strength_index`.

## Financial Ratios

The Ratios Module contains over 50+ ratios that can be used to analyse companies. These ratios are divided into 5 categories which are efficiency, liquidity, profitability, solvency and valuation. Each ratio is calculated using the data from the Toolkit module.  **Find the documentation [here](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs/ratios) which includes an explanation about the ratio, the parameters and an example.**

All of these ratios can be calculated based on (lagged) growth as well as trailing (e.g. TTM) metrics. This is embedded in all ratios as well as the financial statements themselves which means it is possible to calculate revenue growth and 12-month (TTM) Price-to-Earnings with the parameters `growth=True` and `trailing=4` respectively. Note that trailing is based on periods therefore TTM can only be calculated by setting `quarterly=True` in the Toolkit initialization.

# Questions & Answers

This section includes frequently asked questions and is meant to clear up confusion about certain results and/or deviations from other sources. If you have any questions that are not answered here, feel free to reach out to me via the contact details below.

> **How do you deal with companies that have different fiscal years?**

For any financial statement, I make sure to line it up with the corresponding *calendar* period. For example, Apple's Q4 2023 relates to July to September of 2023. This corresponds to the calendar period Q3 which is why I normalize Apple's numbers to Q3 2023 instead. This is done to allow for comparison between companies that have different fiscal years.

> **Why do the numbers in the financial statements sometimes deviate from the data from FinancialModelingPrep?**

When looking at a company such as Hyundai Motor Company (ticker: 005380.KS), you will notice that the financial statements are reported in KRW (South Korean won). As this specific ticker is listed on the Korean Exchange, the historical market data will also be reported in KRW. However, if you use the ticker HYMTF, which is listed on the American OTC market, the historical market data will be reported in USD. To deal with this discrepancy, the end of year or end of quarter exchange rate is retrieved which is used to convert the financial statements to USD. This is done to prevent ratio calculations such as the Free Cash Flow Yield (which is based on the market capitalization) or Price Earnings Ratio (which is based on the stock price) from being incorrect. This can be disabled by setting `convert_currency=False` in the Toolkit initialization. It is recommended to always use the ticker that is listed on the exchange where the company is based.

> **How can I get TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) and Growth metrics?**

Most functions will have the option to define the `trailing` parameter. This lets you define the number of periods that you want to use to calculate the trailing metrics. For example, if you want to calculate the trailing 12-month (TTM) Price-to-Earnings Ratio, you can set `trailing=4` when you have set `quarterly=True` in the Toolkit initialization. The same goes for growth metrics which can be calculated by setting `growth=True`. This will calculate the growth for each period based on the previous period. This also includes a `lag` parameter in which you can define lagged growth. Furthermore, you can also combine the trailing and growth parameters to get trailing growth. For example, set `trailing=4` and `growth=True`  for the Price-to-Earnings Ratio which will then calculate the TTM growth.

> **How can I save the data periodically so that I don't have to retrieve it every single time again?**

The Toolkit initialization has the ability to add custom datasets which can serve as input for external datasets from different providers but also to prevent downloading all of the same data again. Have a look at [this comment](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/issues/68#issuecomment-1748684501) that explains this further.

> **What is the "Benchmark" that is automatically obtained when acquiring historical data?**

This is related to the `benchmark_ticker` parameter which is set to "SPY" (S&P 500) by default. This is important when calculating performance metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio or Treynor Ratio that require a market return. This can be disabled by setting `benchmark_ticker=None` in the Toolkit initialization.

> **Are you part of FinancialModelingPrep?**

*No, I am not*. I've merely picked them as the primary data provider given that they have a generous free tier and fair pricing compared to other providers. Therefore, any questions related to the data should go through [their contact form](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/contact). When it comes to any type of ratios, performance metrics, risk metrics, technical indicators or economic indicators, feel free to reach out to me as this is my own work.

The goal of the Finance Toolkit is to make any type of financial calculation as transparent and efficient as possible. I want to make these type of calculations as accessible to anyone as possible and seeing how many websites exists that do the same thing (but instead you have to pay) gave me plenty of reasons to work on this.
