    The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is a financial metric used to estimate the
    cost of capital for a company. It represents the average rate of return a company must
    pay to its investors for using their capital. WACC takes into account the cost of both
    equity and debt, weighted by their respective proportions in the company's capital
    structure.

    The formula is as follows:

        WACC = (Market Value of Equity / Total Market Value) * Cost of Equity +
        (Market Value of Debt / Total Market Value) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Corporate Tax Rate)

    Args:
        share_price (float or pd.Series): The price of a single share of a company's stock.
        total_shares_outstanding (float or pd.Series): The total number of shares of a company's stock.
        interest_expense (float or pd.Series): Interest expense of the company.
        total_debt (float or pd.Series): Total debt of the company.
        risk_free_rate (float or pd.Series): The risk-free rate is the rate of return of a
        hypothetical investment with no risk of financial loss.
        beta (float or pd.Series): Beta is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk,
        of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole.
        benchmark_returns (float or pd.Series): The benchmark return is the return of a
        chosen benchmark, such as the S&P 500 or the Russell 2000.
        income_tax_expense (float or pd.Series): Income tax expense of the company.
        income_before_tax (float or pd.Series): Income before taxes of the company.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the Dupont analysis components.

    Notes:
    - The market value of equity is calculated as the share price multiplied by the total shares outstanding.
    - The market value of debt is calculated as the total debt. This is a simplification, as the market value of debt
    should be calculated as the present value of all future cash flows of the debt.
    - The cost of equity is calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
    - The cost of debt is calculated as the interest expense divided by the total debt.
    - The corporate tax rate is calculated as the income tax expense divided by the income before taxes.
