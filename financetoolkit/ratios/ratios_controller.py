        Calculate the receivables turnover, a ratio that measures how efficiently a
        company uses its assets by comparing the amount of credit extended to customers to
        the amount of sales generated.

        The receivables turnover ratio is an important measure of how well a company manages its
        accounts receivable. It indicates how quickly a company collects payments from its customers.
        A higher turnover ratio is generally favorable as it suggests that the company is collecting
        payments more quickly, which improves its cash flow and working capital management.

        The formula is as follows:

            Receivables Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable

        Args:
            rounding (int, optional): The number of decimals to round the results to. Defaults to 4.

        ability to service its debt with its net operating income.

        The debt service coverage ratio provides insights into a company's ability to meet its
        debt obligations from its operating income. It is especially important for companies
        with significant debt obligations, as a lower ratio indicates higher financial risk and
        potential difficulties in servicing debt payments.

        The formula is as follows:

            Debt Service Coverage Ratio = Operating Income / Total Current Liabilities

        Args:
            rounding (int, optional): The number of decimals to round the results to. Defaults to 4.
            growth (bool, optional): Whether to calculate the growth of the ratios. Defaults to False.
            lag (int | str, optional): The lag to use for the growth calculation. Defaults to 1.
            trailing (int): Defines whether to select a trailing period.
            E.g. when selecting 4 with quarterly data, the TTM is calculated.

        Returns:
