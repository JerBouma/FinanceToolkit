        with a breakdown for food, energy and total.

        Inflation measures the erosion of living standards. A consumer price index is
        estimated as a series of summary measures of the period-to-period proportional

        Long-term interest rates refer to government bonds maturing in ten years.
        Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk
        from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest rates
        are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest
        rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on
        financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued.

        In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments.
        Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long
        term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates
        discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth

        The Governing Council of the ECB sets the key interest rates for the
        euro area. The available rates are:

        - Main refinancing operations (refinancing)
        - Marginal lending facility (lending)
        - Deposit facility (deposit)

        The main refinancing operations (MRO) rate is the interest rate banks
        pay when they borrow money from the ECB for one week. When they do this,
        they have to provide collateral to guarantee that the money will be paid back.

        The marginal lending facility rate is the interest rate banks pay when they
        borrow from the ECB overnight. When they do this, they have to provide collateral,
        for example securities, to guarantee that the money will be paid back.

        The deposit facility rate is one of the three interest rates the ECB sets every
        six weeks as part of its monetary policy. The rate defines the interest banks
        receive for depositing money with the central bank overnight.

        - Broad General Collateral Rate (BGCR)
        - Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)

        The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) is calculated as a volume-weighted median
        of overnight federal funds transactions reported in the FR 2420 Report of Selected
        Money Market Rates.

        The overnight bank funding rate (OBFR) is calculated as a volume-weighted median
        of overnight federal funds transactions, Eurodollar transactions, and the
        domestic deposits reported as “Selected Deposits” in the FR 2420 Report.

        The TGCR is calculated as a volume-weighted median of transaction-level
        tri-party repo data collected from the Bank of New York Mellon.

        The BGCR is calculated as a volume-weighted median of transaction-level
        tri-party repo data collected from the Bank of New York Mellon as well
        as GCF Repo transaction data obtained from the U.S. Department of the
        Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR).

        The SOFR is calculated as a volume-weighted median of transaction-level
        tri-party repo data collected from the Bank of New York Mellon as well as
        GCF Repo transaction data and data on bilateral Treasury repo transactions
        cleared through FICC's DVP service, which are obtained from the U.S.

        sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) given as quantities of SO2 and NO2, emissions of
        carbon monoxide (CO), and emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC), excluding methane.

        Air and greenhouse gas emissions are measured in tonnes per capita and kilogram per capita
        in which all metrics are converted to tonnes (1000kg) per capita.

        Crude oil production is defined as the quantities of oil extracted from the ground after
        the removal of inert matter or impurities. It includes crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs)
        and additives. This indicator is measured in thousand tonne of oil equivalent (toe).

        Crude oil is a mineral oil consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons of natural origin, yellow
        to black in colour, and of variable density and viscosity. NGLs are the liquid or liquefied
        hydrocarbons produced in the manufacture, purification and stabilisation of natural gas.

        Additives are non-hydrocarbon substances added to or blended with a product to modify its
        properties, for example, to improve its combustion characteristics (e.g. MTBE and tetraethyl lead).
        Refinery production refers to the output of secondary oil products from an oil refinery.

        by volume as recorded by customs administrations for each tariff position.

        Values are recorded at the time of import and include cost, insurance and freight, but exclude
        import duties. The nominal crude oil spot price from 2003 to 2011 is for Dubai and from 1970 to
        2002 for Arabian Light. This indicator is measured in USD per barrel of oil.

        This function contains a variety of general government statistics. The following statistics are provided:

            - General government deficit is defined as the balance of income and expenditure of government,
            including capital income and capital expenditures. "Net lending" means that government has a
            surplus, and is providing financial resources to other sectors, while "net borrowing" means
            that government has a deficit, and requires financial resources from other sectors.
            - General government revenue is defined as the revenue required to finance the goods
            and services they provide to citizens and businesses, and to fulfil their redistributive role.
            Comparing levels of government revenues across countries provides an indication of the
            importance of the government sector in the economy in terms of available financial resources.
            The total amount of revenues collected by governments is determined by past
            and current political decisions.
            - General government spending is defined as an indicator of the size of government
            across countries. The large variation in this indicator highlights the variety of
            countries' approaches to delivering public goods and services and providing
            social protection, not necessarily differences in resources spent
            - General government final consumption can be broken down into two distinct groups.
            The first reflects expenditures for collective consumption (defence, justice, etc.)
            that benefit the society as a whole, or large parts of society, and are often known
            as public goods and services. The second, referred to as "individual", relates to
            expenditures for individual consumption (health care, housing, education, etc.),
            incurred by government for the benefit of individual households.
            - General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general
            government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability
            of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability
            categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans;
            insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable.
            Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.
            - The net financial worth of the general government sector is the total value of its
            financial assets minus the total value of its outstanding liabilities. The general
            government sector consists of central, state and local governments as well as social
            security funds.
            - General government production costs are decisions about the amount and type of goods
            and services governments produce, as well as on how best to produce them. They are
            often political in nature and based on a country's social and cultural context.
            Governments use a mix of their own employees, capital, and outside contractors
            (non-profit institutions or private sector entities) to produce goods and services.
            Government production costs include: compensation costs of general government employees;
            goods and services used and financed by general government (including intermediate consumption
            and social transfer in kind via market producers paid for by government); and other costs,
            including depreciation of capital and other taxes on production less other subsidies on
            production. The data include government employment and intermediate consumption for output
            produced by the government for its own use, such as roads and other capital investment
            projects built by government employees.

        All of these metrics are reported as a percentage of GDP which makes comparison between countries
        relatively straight forward.

        Central government expenditure is defined as the central government budget expenditure
        as reported in the final central government accounts. Data are based on the System of
        National accounts (SNA), a set of internationally agreed concepts, definitions, classifications
        and rules for national accounting.

        Central government spending by function is the breakdown of expenditures on the basis of the
        activities governments support. The classification system used to provide this breakdown on an
        internationally comparable basis is known as Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG).

        COFOG expenditures are divided into in the following ten functions:

            - General Public Services;
            - Defence;
            - Public Order and Safety;
            - Economic Affairs;
            - Environmental Protection;
            - Housing and Community Amenities;
            - Health;
            - Recreation, Culture and Religion;
            - Education;
            - Social Protection.

        Data on central government expenditures by function include transfers between the different levels
        of government. The general government sector consists of central, state and local governments,
        and the social security funds controlled by these units. The political authority of central
        government extends over the entire territory of the country; central government has the authority
        to impose taxes on all resident and non-resident units engaged in economic activities within the
        country.

        The responsibility for the provision of public goods and services and redistribution of income is
        divided between different levels of government. Data on the distribution of government spending
        by both level and function can provide an indication of the extent to which key government activities
        are decentralised to sub-national governments. This indicator of central government spending by
        function is measured as a percentage of total expenditures.

        GDP per hour worked is a measure of labour productivity. It measures
        how efficiently labour input is combined with other factors of production
        and used in the production process. Labour input is defined as total hours
        worked of all persons engaged in production. Labour productivity only partially
        reflects the productivity of labour in terms of the personal capacities of
        workers or the intensity of their effort.

        inputs, technical, organisational and efficiency change, economies of scale).

        attributed to each of its members, with an adjustment to reflect differences in needs for
        households of different sizes. Income inequality among individuals is measured here by five indicators.

            cumulative proportions of income they receive, and it ranges between 0 in the case of perfect equality

            pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the Poverty Rates.

        As an example:

        ```python
        from financetoolkit import Economics

        economics = Economics(start_date='2012-01-01', end_date='2020-01-01')

        poverty_rate = economics.get_poverty_rate()

        poverty_rate.loc[:, 'Portugal']
        ```

        Which returns:
