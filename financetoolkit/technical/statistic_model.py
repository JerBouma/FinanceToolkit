    """
    Calculate the beta of returns with respect to a benchmark over a rolling window.

    Beta measures the sensitivity of an asset's returns to changes in the returns of a benchmark.
    It indicates the asset's risk in relation to the benchmark. A beta greater than 1 suggests
    the asset is more volatile than the benchmark, while a beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility.

    Args:
        returns (pd.Series): A Series of returns.
        benchmark_returns (pd.Series): A Series of benchmark returns.

        pd.Series: A Series of beta values with assets as index.

    Calculate Pearson's Correlation Coefficient between two given series.

    Pearson's Correlation Coefficient measures the linear relationship between two sets of data points.
    It ranges from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 indicating
    no linear correlation. Positive values suggest a positive linear relationship, while negative values
    suggest a negative linear relationship.

    Calculate the Spearman Correlation Coefficient between two given data series.

    Spearman Correlation Coefficient measures the strength and direction of monotonic relationship
    between two sets of data points. It is a non-parametric measure, meaning it assesses the similarity
    in the ranks of data points rather than their actual values.

    Args:

    Calculate the Variance of a given data series.

    Variance measures the spread or dispersion of data points around the mean.
    A higher variance indicates more variability in the data, while a lower variance
    suggests that the data points are closer to the mean.

def get_standard_deviation(prices: pd.Series) -> float:

    Calculate the Standard Deviation of a given data series.

    Standard Deviation measures the amount of dispersion or variability in a set of data points.
    It is the square root of the Variance. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability,
    while a lower standard deviation suggests that data points are closer to the mean.
