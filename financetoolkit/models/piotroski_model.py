    Calculate the Piotroski Score, a comprehensive financial assessment tool that helps investors and analysts

    The Piotroski Score was developed by Joseph Piotroski and is based on a set of nine fundamental financial criteria.
    Each criterion is assigned a score of 0 or 1, and the scores are then summed to calculate the Piotroski Score.

    The nine criteria are categorized into three groups:

    1. Profitability:
        - Return on Assets (ROA) Criteria: Measures the profitability of the company.
        - Operating Cash Flow Criteria: Evaluates the company's ability to generate cash from its operations.
        - Change in ROA Criteria: Assesses the trend in ROA over time.
        - Accruals Criteria: Examines the quality of earnings.

    2. Leverage, Liquidity, and Operating Efficiency:
        - Change in Leverage Criteria: Analyzes changes in the company's leverage (debt).
        - Change in Current Ratio Criteria: Evaluates changes in the current ratio.
        - Number of Shares Criteria: Assesses the issuance of common shares.

    3. Operating Efficiency and Asset Utilization:
        - Gross Margin Criteria: Examines the company's gross margin, a measure of profitability.
        - Asset Turnover Ratio Criteria: Evaluates the efficiency of asset utilization and sales generation.

    The Piotroski Score is calculated by summing the scores assigned to each of the nine criteria.
    The maximum possible score is 9, indicating the highest financial strength, while the minimum score is 0,
    suggesting potential financial weaknesses.

    Args:
        return_on_assets_criteria (float | pd.Series | pd.DataFrame): Criteria indicating
        the company's return on assets.

        operating cash flow.
        change_in_return_on_asset_criteria (float | pd.Series | pd.DataFrame): Criteria indicating changes
        in return on assets.
        accruals_criteria (float | pd.Series | pd.DataFrame): Criteria indicating
        the quality of earnings.

        asset turnover ratio.

    Returns:
        pd.Series | pd.DataFrame: The Piotroski Score, a numerical representation of a company's
        fundamental financial strength.
        A higher score indicates stronger financial health, while a lower score may suggest potential weaknesses.

    Notes:
    - A high Piotroski Score can be seen as a positive signal for investors, indicating that a company
    meets several favorable financial criteria.
    - It is essential to interpret the Piotroski Score in conjunction with other financial analysis and market research,
      as it provides insights into a company's financial condition but may not capture all aspects of its performance.
