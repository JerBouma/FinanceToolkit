        Calculate the Beta, a measurement that assess the systematic risk of a stock or investment.

        Beta is a financial metric used to assess the systematic risk of a stock or investment in
        relation to the overall market. It provides valuable insights into how a particular asset's
        returns tend to move in response to fluctuations in the broader market. A stock's Beta is
        calculated by analyzing its historical price movements and their correlation with the
        movements of a market index, typically the benchmark index like the S&P 500.

        The formula is as follows:

            - Beta = Covariance of Asset Returns and Benchmark Returns / Variance of Benchmark Returns

        For a given period, for example monthly, this translates into the following:

            - Beta = Monthly Covariance of Asset Returns and Benchmark Returns
            / Monthly Variance of Benchmark Returns

        See definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_(finance)

        Args:
            period (str, optional): The period to use for the calculation. Defaults to None which
            results in basing it off the quarterly parameter as defined in the class instance.
            rolling (int, optional): The rolling period to use for the calculation. If you select
            period = 'monthly' and set rolling to 12 you obtain the rolling 12-month Sharpe Ratio.
            rounding (int, optional): The number of decimals to round the results to. Defaults to 4.
            growth (bool, optional): Whether to calculate the growth of the ratios. Defaults to False.
            lag (int | str, optional): The lag to use for the growth calculation. Defaults to 1.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: Beta values.

        Notes:
        - Daily Beta is not an option as the standard deviation for 1 day is close to zero. Therefore, it does
        not give any useful insights.
        - The method retrieves historical data and calculates the Beta for each asset in the Toolkit instance.
        - The risk-free rate is often represented by the return of a risk-free investment, such as a Treasury bond.

        CAPM, or the Capital Asset Pricing Model, is a financial model used to estimate the expected return
        on an investment, such as a stock or portfolio of stocks. It provides a framework for evaluating the
        risk and return trade-off of an asset or portfolio in relation to the overall market. CAPM is based
        on the following key components:

            - Risk-Free Rate (Rf): This is the theoretical return an investor could earn from an investment
            with no risk of financial loss. It is typically based on the yield of a government bond.
            - Market Risk Premium (Rm - Rf): This represents the additional return that investors expect
            to earn for taking on the risk of investing in the overall market as opposed to a risk-free asset.
            It is calculated as the difference between the expected return of the market (Rm) and the risk-free
            rate (Rf).
            - Beta (β): Beta is a measure of an asset's or portfolio's sensitivity to market movements. It
            quantifies how much an asset's returns are expected to move in relation to changes in the
            overall market. A beta of 1 indicates that the asset moves in line with the market, while a
            beta greater than 1 suggests higher volatility, and a beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility.

        The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a widely used financial model that helps in
        determining the expected return of an asset or portfolio based on its systematic risk and
        the prevailing risk-free rate in the market. CAPM provides insights into how an asset or
        investment should be priced in order to offer an appropriate rate of return, given its
        level of risk compared to the overall market.

        The formula is as follows:

            Capital Asset Pricing Model = Risk Free Rate + Beta * (Benchmark Returns - Risk Free Rate)

        See definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model

        Args:
            period (str, optional): The period to use for the calculation. Defaults to None which
            results in basing it off the quarterly parameter as defined in the class instance.
            show_full_results (bool, optional): Whether to show the full results. Defaults to False.
            rounding (int, optional): The number of decimals to round the results to. Defaults to 4.
            growth (bool, optional): Whether to calculate the growth of the ratios. Defaults to False.
            lag (int | str, optional): The lag to use for the growth calculation. Defaults to 1.

        The major difference between the Fama and French Model here is that the correlation
        is taken as opposed to a Linear Regression in which the R-squared or Slope can be used to
        understand the exposure to each factor.

        For assessing the exposure or influence of a stock to external factors, it's often preferable
        to use R-squared (R²) or Beta because it explicitly measures how well the factors explain the stock's
        returns. A higher R² indicates that the stock's returns are more closely related to the factors,
        and thus, the factors have a greater influence on the stock's performance.

        However, since the results are closely related and tend to point into the same direction it could
        be fine to use correlations as well depending on the level of accuracy required.

        Calculate Fama and French 5 Factor model scores and residuals for a set of financial assets.

        The Fama and French 5 Factor model is a widely used financial model that helps estimate the expected return
        of financial assets, such as stocks or portfolios, based on five key factors:

            - Market Risk Premium (Mkt-RF): Represents the additional return that investors expect to earn for taking
            on the risk of investing in the overall market as opposed to a risk-free asset.
            - Size Premium (SMB): Reflects the historical excess return of small-cap stocks over large-cap stocks.
            - Value Premium (HML): Captures the historical excess return of value stocks over growth stocks.
            - Profitability (RMW): Measures the historical excess return of high profitability stocks over
            low profitability stocks.
            - Investment (CMA): Quantifies the historical excess return of low investment stocks over
            high investment stocks.

        The model can perform both a Simple Linear Regression on each factor as well as a Multi Linear Regression
        which includes all factors. Generally, a multi linear regression is applied but if you wish to see individual
        R-squared values for each factor you can select the simple linear regression method.

        The model performs a Linear Regression on each factor and defines the regression parameters and residuals
        for each asset over time based on its exposure to these factors.

        These results can be validated by comparing them to the period returns obtained from the historical data. E.g.
        the regression formula is as follows for the Multi Linear Regression:

            - Excess Return = Intercept + Beta1 * Mkt-RF + Beta2 * SMB + Beta3 * HML + Beta4 * RMW
                + Beta5 * CMA + Residuals

        And the following for the Simple Linear Regression:

            - Excess Return = Intercept + Slope * Factor Value + Residuals

        So for a given factor, it should hold that the Excess Return equals the entire regression. Note that in this
        calculation the Excess Return refers to the Asset Return minus the Risk Free Rate as reported in the Fama and
        French dataset and will not be the same as the defined Excess Return in the historical data given that this is
        based on the Risk Free Rate defined in the initialization.

        What is relevant to look at is the influence these factors have on each stock and how much each factor explains
        the stock return. E.g. you will generally see a pretty high influence (Beta or Slope) for the Market Risk Premium
        (Mkt-RF) factor as this is the main factor that explains the stock return (as also prevalent in the CAPM).
        The other factors can fluctuate greatly between stocks depending on which stocks you look at.

        Args:
            period (str, optional): The period for the calculation (e.g., "weekly", "monthly", "quarterly", "yearly").
                Defaults to None, using class-defined quarterly or yearly period.
            method (str, optional): The regression method to use for the calculation. Defaults to 'multi'.
            factors_to_calculate (list of str, optional): List of factors to calculate scores and residuals for.
                Defaults to ["Mkt-RF", "SMB", "HML", "RMW", "CMA"].
            include_residuals (bool, optional): Whether to include residuals in the results. Defaults to False.
            rounding (int, optional): The number of decimals to round the results to. Defaults to 4.
            growth (bool, optional): Whether to calculate the growth of the ratio values. Defaults to False.
            lag (int or list of int, optional): The lag to use for the growth calculation. Defaults to 1.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: Fama and French 5 Factor model scores for the specified assets.

        Notes:
        - The dataset from Fama and French is not always fully up to date. Therefore, some periods could be excluded.
        - Daily Fama and French results is not an option as it would attempt to do a linear regression on a
        single data point which will not give any meaningful results.
        - The method retrieves historical data and calculates regression parameters and residuals for each asset.
        - The risk-free rate is typically represented by the return of a risk-free investment, such as a Treasury bond.
        In this case, the Risk Free Rate from the Fama and French dataset is used.
        - If `growth` is set to True, the method calculates the growth of the ratio values using the specified `lag`.

        or strategy. It assesses the excess return generated by the portfolio relative
        to a risk-free investment, taking into account the portfolio's volatility or risk.
        The M2 Ratio helps investors and portfolio managers determine whether the portfolio
        is delivering returns that justify its level of risk.

        The formula is as follows:

            - M2 Ratio = (Portfolio's Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Standard Deviation

        See definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani_risk-adjusted_performance

        Args:
            period (str, optional): The period to use for the calculation. Defaults to None which
            results in basing it off the quarterly parameter as defined in the class instance.
            rounding (int, optional): The number of decimals to round the results to. Defaults to 4.
            growth (bool, optional): Whether to calculate the growth of the ratios. Defaults to False.
            lag (int | str, optional): The lag to use for the growth calculation. Defaults to 1.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: M2 ratio values.

        Notes:
        - Daily M2 is not an option as the standard deviation for 1 day is close to zero. Therefore, it does
        not give any useful insights.
        - The method retrieves historical data and calculates the M2 for each asset in the Toolkit instance.
        - The risk-free rate is often represented by the return of a risk-free investment, such as a Treasury bond.
        - If `growth` is set to True, the method calculates the growth of the ratio values using the specified `lag`.

        Tracking Error is a financial metric that quantifies the volatility or dispersion of the
        difference between the returns of an investment portfolio or asset and the returns of a
        benchmark index. It measures how closely the portfolio tracks its benchmark and provides
        insights into the consistency of the portfolio's performance relative to the benchmark.

        The Information Ratio (IR), also known as the Information Coefficient, is a financial
        metric that assesses the risk-adjusted performance of a portfolio or investment
        strategy relative to a benchmark index. It quantifies how much excess return the
        portfolio generates for each unit of tracking error (volatility of tracking error).
        The Information Ratio is commonly used by portfolio managers, financial analysts, and
        investors to evaluate the skill of a portfolio manager in generating returns beyond
        what would be expected based on the risk taken.

        - IR > 0: A positive Information Ratio indicates that the portfolio has generated
        excess returns compared to the benchmark, suggesting that the portfolio manager has added value.
        - IR = 0: An Information Ratio of zero implies that the portfolio's excess return
        is in line with the benchmark, meaning the portfolio manager has not added or lost value relative
        to the benchmark.
        - IR < 0: A negative Information Ratio suggests that the portfolio has underperformed
        the benchmark, potentially indicating that the portfolio manager has detracted value.

        This function calculates the Compound Growth Rate (CGR) for different periods: yearly, quarterly, monthly,

        The CGR is a measure that provides the mean growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time.
        It is a useful measure for comparing the performance of investments over different time periods or across
        different asset classes. The CGR is calculated by taking the ratio of the final value to the initial value,
        raising it to the inverse of the number of periods, and then subtracting one.

        The formula is as follows:

            - CGR = (Final Value / Initial Value) ^ (1 / Number of Periods) - 1

        Args:
            rounding (int, optional): The number of decimals to round the results to. If not provided,

            pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the CGR for each period. The DataFrame has the periods
            as the index and the CGR values as the column.

        Notes:
        - When verifying the calculation, note that rounding applies and it could be slightly off because of that
        This is mostly noticeable when looking at the Compound Daily Growth Rate. Adjust the rounding with the
        rounding parameter accordingly to get a more precise figure.
