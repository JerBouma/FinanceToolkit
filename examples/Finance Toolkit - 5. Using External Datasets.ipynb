    "The Finance Toolkit can take in any dataset which means it works very well with the software and APIs from any other provider let is be Intrinio, OpenBB, Yahoo Finance, Quandl, etc. For this illustration, I have collected custom statements and have imported them as a CSV file but as you can imagine this would also work with direct API calls. This dataset is obtained from Yahoo Finance, which can be collected via `yfinance`. Note that the `yfinance` library is not part of the Finance Toolkit and needs to be installed separately."
